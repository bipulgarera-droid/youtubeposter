# Script Style Guide

> Based on analysis of Chill Financial Historian transcripts (~45,000 words, 5 scripts).
> Use this directive when generating video scripts.

---

## Script Structure

Every script follows this exact framework:

### 1. HOOK (First 30 seconds)
```
- Vivid scene-setting in second person
- "Imagine for a second that you are..."
- Big shocking number or stat
- Promise of revelation ("Today we're going to dissect...")
- Buckle up line
```

**Example:**
> "Imagine for a second that you are the CEO of a massive manufacturing company. You make steel, chemicals, or cars... But it's 2023. You walk onto the factory floor and it's quiet. Too quiet."

---

### 2. CONTEXT SECTION (1-2 minutes)
```
- "To understand how we got here, we have to go back to..."
- Historical origin story (30-50 years back)
- Set up the "original sin" of the problem
```

**Example:**
> "To understand how we got to the edge of the cliff, we have to go back to 2010. It feels like a lifetime ago. The iPhone 4 was brand new..."

---

### 3. NUMBERED CHAPTERS (7 sections)

**Fixed structure: 7 chapters + Final Thoughts**

Each chapter follows this pattern:
```
"[Number]. [Chapter Title], [Subtitle]"

- Setup the problem
- Specific data/stats
- Vivid analogy to make it relatable
- Consequence/so what
```

**Chapter title examples:**
- "One. The Knee-Jerk Reaction, How Fear Killed the Atom"
- "Two. The Russian Needle, Addicted to Cheap Gas"
- "Six. The North-South Divide, A Tale of Two Italies"
- "Seven. The Debt Trap, Living on Borrowed Time"

---

### 4. MID-ROLL CTA (Around 50% mark)
```
- Self-deprecating humor
- "If you're enjoying this breakdown of economic collapse, hit subscribe"
- "Unlike the [subject], it still works"
- Poll question for comments
```

**Example:**
> "Listen, I know this is heavy. If you are enjoying this cheerful breakdown of economic collapse, do me a favor and destroy that like button. Unlike the European economy, it still works."

---

### 5. FINAL SECTION
```
- "Final Thoughts" or "Is There Any Hope?"
- Summarize all the problems
- Small ray of hope (optional)
- Return agency to viewer
```

**Example:**
> "So, is this it? Is Italy destined to become a third world country with first-class ruins? I know this video has been heavy... It looks hopeless, but Italy has surprised the world before."

---

### 6. OUTRO (30 seconds)
```
- "What do you think?"
- Specific question for comments
- If [nationality], tell me I'm wrong
- Like button CTA with humor
- "Thank you for watching. I'll see you in the next video."
```

---

## Writing Voice

### Tone:
- Conversational but authoritative
- Dark humor about serious topics
- Second person direct address ("You're sitting in Berlin...")
- Gaming/internet metaphors ("final boss", "cheat code")

### Sentence patterns:
- Short punchy sentences for emphasis
- Rhetorical questions followed by answers
- "But here's the thing..." transitions
- Numbers humanized: "That's €48,000 strapped to every man, woman, and child"

### Power phrases:
- "Let me put this in perspective..."
- "Think about the level of [X] required for that..."
- "The message was clear..."
- "Here's the terrifying reality..."
- "This is the hidden cost that..."
- "And here's the kicker..."

---

## Research Depth

Scripts reference:
- **Primary sources**: WikiLeaks cables, Basel III regulations, OECD data
- **Specific numbers**: GDP percentages, debt figures, population stats
- **Historical context**: Go back 30-50 years minimum
- **Local terminology**: Use native terms (Dunkel Flaute, Pizzo, Question Méridional)
- **One "insider" reveal**: Leaked document, obscure regulation, or expert quote

---

## Word Count

**Fixed target: 4,500 words** (~22-25 minutes of video)

This is non-negotiable. The outline structure will be consistent across all videos.

---

## Topic Selection Logic

### News-Triggered (60%):
Wait for current event, then write the "deep dive" that explains WHY:
- Major protest/crisis in a country
- Economic policy announcement
- Geopolitical event (war, sanctions, election)

### Evergreen (40%):
Always-relevant topics that don't require news peg:
- Geography advantages (US invasion)
- Structural economic problems
- Historical analysis

## Script Generation Prompt Template

```
Generate a YouTube script in the Chill Financial Historian style.

TOPIC: [topic]
TITLE: [title]
TARGET LENGTH: [X] words (~[Y] minutes)

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
[Paste research findings here]

STRUCTURE:
1. Hook (30 sec) - vivid scene, shocking stat, promise
2. Context - historical origin story
3. Chapters 1-7 - numbered sections with data + analogies
4. Mid-roll CTA at ~50%
5. Final thoughts - summary + hope
6. Outro - question + like CTA

VOICE: Conversational, dark humor, second person, gaming metaphors
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Research FIRST, then outline, then script
2. Each chapter should be self-contained but flow naturally
3. Include [music] markers for background music cues
4. Data must be specific (not "millions" but "$630 billion")
5. End each chapter with a bridge to the next
