Germany’s $500 Billion Mistake (The Green Energy Trap )

Imagine for a second that you are the CEO of a massive manufacturing company. You make steel, chemicals, or cars. The stuff that built the modern world. You're in Germany, the economic engine of Europe, a place known for precision, efficiency, and engineering supremacy. But it's 2023. You walk onto the factory floor and it's quiet. Too quiet. You aren't shut down because you ran out of customers. You aren't shut down because your workers are on strike. You're shut down because you literally cannot afford to turn the lights on. Welcome to the energy vendor, The Energy Turnaround. It was supposed to be humanity's glorious transition into a utopia of wind, solar, and guilt-free electricity. Germany spent over $500 billion, half a trillion dollars, trying to engineer this green miracle. And what did they get for that mountain of cash? They got the highest electricity prices in the developed world, a de-industrializing economy, and here is the darkest irony of all. They are currently tearing down wind farms to expand coal mines. Yeah, you heard that right. Today, we are going to dissect the most expensive unforced error in modern economic history. We're going to look at how a mix of hubris, geopolitical blindness, and panic led a superpower into a trap of its own making. Buckle up. [music] It's going to be a bumpy, expensive ride. One, the knee-jerk reaction, how fear killed the atom. To understand how we got to the edge of the cliff, we have to go back to 2010. It feels like a lifetime ago. The iPhone 4 was brand new. People were still doing the duggey. And in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, a literal physicist with a PhD in quantum chemistry, actually extended the lifespan of Germany's nuclear power plants. At the time, Germany was sitting pretty. They had a robust mix of nuclear, coal, and renewables. Nuclear provided about 25% of the country's power. It was clean, it was stable, and it was cheap. The plan was sensible. Used nuclear as a bridge while slowly ramping up renewables over decades. But then on March 11th, 2011, the earth shook in Japan. The Tohoku earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that slammed into the Fukushima Dai nuclear power plant. It was a disaster, a tragedy, but it happened 5,000 mi away from Germany in a seismically active zone involving a 40-year-old plant design. Germany, for the record, is not known for its massive tsunamis. Logic would dictate a safety review, right? Maybe check your backup generators, but politics isn't about logic. It's about emotion. And the German public was terrified. The anti-uclear movement in Germany, fueled by the Green Party, D Grunan, went into overdrive. They had been protesting nuclear energy since the Chernobyl days of the 80s, and this was their I told you so moment. So, what did the physicist chancellor do? Did she look at the data? Did she calculate the base load requirements for the world's fourth largest economy? No, she panicked, or rather, she made a calculated political pivot to save her coalition. Days after Fukushima, Merkel announced the Atomosig, the nuclear phase out. Germany would shut down all of its nuclear reactors by 2022. Eight of them were switched off immediately. Just click, gone. This is the original sin of the German energy crisis. Let's put this in perspective. Imagine you live in a house with a very reliable, albeit scaryl looking furnace. You decide you want to switch to solar panels on the roof. Great idea. But instead of installing the panels first and then turning off the furnace, you smash the furnace with a sledgehammer in the middle of winter and say, "Don't worry, the sun will come out eventually." Germany took 17 trusted, paidoff zerocarbon power plants and decided to throw them in the trash. Why is this a $500 billion mistake? Because simply building wind turbines is expensive, sure, but building wind turbines to replace working nuclear plants is economic suicide. You aren't adding capacity, you're [music] just spending billions to run in place. Between 2010 and 2020, Germany poured massive subsidies into the EEG, Renewable Energy Sources Act. Homeowners and businesses paid a search charge on every kilowatt hour to fund this transition. German electricity prices skyrocketed to nearly three times the US average. And here is the kicker, the punchline that nobody's laughing at. Despite spending hundreds of billions on renewables, Germany's carbon emissions barely moved for a decade. Why? Because when the wind didn't blow and the sun didn't shine, which happens a lot in Northern Europe, they couldn't turn the nuclear plants back on. So, they burned ligignite coal, the dirtiest, nastiest fossil fuel on the planet. They killed the cleanest form of base load power to save the environment and ended up relying on the sootiest rock in the ground. Two, the Russian needle addicted to cheap gas. Okay, so you've killed your nuclear plants. You have a lot of wind and solar, but they are intermittent. You need a backup plan for those dark, windless days. What Germans call dungle flout. If you want to get off coal eventually, what's the bridge fuel? Natural gas. It burns cleaner than coal. You can spin the turbines up fast, and it's great for industrial heat, which Germany needs for making chemicals and steel. But Germany doesn't have much gas of its own. Enter the dealer Vladimir Putin. For decades, Germany operated under a policy called Wandel Dur handle change through trade. The idea was incredibly optimistic. If we buy enough gas from Russia, if we entangle our economies, Russia will become a nice liberal democracy. We won't go to war with our best customer, right? This led to the construction of Nordstream 1 and the planning of Nordstream 2. These were massive pipelines running under the Baltic Sea. designed to pump cheap Siberian gas directly into the veins of German industry. It was a drug and Germany was the junkie. By 2021, Germany was importing 55% of its natural gas from Russia. Their entire manufacturing model, BASF, buyer, Volkswagen, was predicated on the assumption that cheap Russian gas would flow forever. There were warnings. Oh, there were so many warnings. The Poles warned them. The Ukrainians warned them. The Baltic states screamed from the rooftops that this was a geopolitical trap. They said, "You're handing the Kremlin a kill switch for your economy." And let's not forget the most viral moment of them all. In 2018, at the United Nations, then President Donald Trump said this. Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course. The camera cut to the German delegation. They were smirking. They were laughing. They looked at each other like, "Listen to this idiot. He doesn't understand highlevel European diplomacy. Fast forward to February 2022. Russian tanks roll into Ukraine. The laughter stopped real quick. Suddenly, the change through trade policy looked less like sophisticated diplomacy and more like suicidal negligence. When the sanctions hit and Russia throttled the gas flows and then the pipelines mysteriously blew up, but that's a whole other video. Germany was caught with its pants down in a blizzard. The price of gas didn't just go up, it went vertical. Spot market prices increased by a,000% at the peak. Remember that factory owner from the beginning of the video? Suddenly, his energy bill went from $1 million a month to $10 million. You can't absorb that. You can't pass that on to customers who can just buy steel from China or the US. So, the German government had to scramble. They had to bail out utility giant Uniper to the tune of $30 billion just to keep the lights on. They had to spend hundreds of billions more to subsidize energy bills for citizens to prevent riots. This is where the trap snaps shut. Germany shut down its nuclear, so no backup there. It alienated itself from fossil fuels ideologically. And then its main supplier of the one fuel it did allow, gas, [music] turned into an enemy of the state. Economic Minister Robert Hbeck from the Green Party ironically had to go on a humiliating world tour bowing to the Emiratar begging for LNG, liqufied natural gas to replace the Russian pipeline gas. And the irony that LG is much more expensive than the Russian gas was. It has to be cooled, shipped across the ocean, and regified. This means the era of cheap German manufacturing is likely gone forever. The competitive advantage that made M made in Germany a global powerhouse, highquality at a competitive price, was secretly subsidized by cheap Russian hydrocarbons. Now that the subsidy is gone, the cracks in the foundation are turning into canyons. We're just getting started. In the next section, we're going to look at the de-industrialization of Europe and why major German companies are packing their bags and moving to Texas. If you want to understand the global economy without the boring jargon, make sure you smash that subscribe button. It helps the algorithm and it helps me afford my own electricity bill. Also, let me know in the comments. Do you think Germany should restart its nuclear plants or is it too late? I read every comment. Three, the de-industrialization disaster. Goodbye. Made in Germany. If you want to see the real cost of this energy trap, you don't look at a utility bill. You look at Ludvik's hoffen. This is the home of BASF, the largest chemical producer in the world. This one site consumes about as much natural gas as all of Switzerland. For decades, this was the beating heart of German industry, turning cheap Russian gas into the fertilizers, plastics, and vitamins that the world buys. But in 2023, the heart started skipping beats. BASF announced it was permanently downsizing in Europe. They cut 2,600 jobs at their flagship plant. They shut down one of their ammonia plants. And where are they moving that investment? China. BASF [music] is building a $10 billion state-of-the-art complex in Janjang, China. Why? Because in China, the energy is cheap, and the government isn't trying to guilt trip you for using it. And they aren't alone. It's a mass exodus. Mle, the company that makes those invincible washing machines, announced they are moving production to Poland. Volkswagen is openly discussing building its next battery factories in Canada and the US. chasing the juicy subsidies from the inflation reduction act. Economists have a polite term for this, structural change. I have a more accurate term, deindustrialization. Think about what this means. Germany is an export economy. It doesn't have Facebook or Google. It has things you can touch. It makes stuff. If you take away the ability to make stuff competitively, what is left? A really nice museum with good beer. The CEO [music] of BASF, Martin Brutdermiller, didn't mince words. He said, "Europe is becoming increasingly uncompetitive." That CEO speak for we are leaving before the ship sinks. This isn't just about rich shareholders losing money. This is about the high-paying middle-class union jobs that hold a society together. When the steel mills close, they don't come back. When the chemical plants move to China, they stay in China. Germany is literally hollowing itself out to meet carbon targets that the rest of the world is ignoring. It's like setting your own house on fire to show the neighbors how serious you are about fire safety. Four, the grid bottleneck. The $4 billion ghost electricity scandal. Okay, let's get technical for a minute because this is where the incompetence truly shines. Germany has a geography problem. The wind blows in the north where the ocean is. The factories are in the south where BMW and Seammens are. To get the power from A to B, you need massive high voltage transmission lines. The biggest one is called [music] Swed Link. It was supposed to be the main artery of the energy transition. The original plan, have it ready by 2022, just in time for the nuclear phase out. The reality, it's stuck in bureaucratic hell. Due to endless lawsuits and nimi not in my backyard protests, [music] they had to agree to bury the cables underground, which tripled the cost and delayed the project. The new completion date, 2028, maybe. So, what happens today when a storm hits the North Sea and the wind turbines spin like crazy? You have too much power in the North and no way to send it south. The grid gets overloaded. To prevent a blackout, the grid operators have to tell the wind farms to turn off. But here is the kicker. The wind farms still get paid. It's called redispatch, or as I call it, ghost electricity. German consumers are paying wind farms billions of euros not to produce power. In 2022 alone, the cost of this congestion management hit a record $4.2 billion. Let that sink in. You're paying for wind turbines to sit idle in the north. Meanwhile, because that power can't reach the south, the factories in Bavaria have to fire up, you guessed it, coal and gas plants to keep running, you're paying twice. Once for the green energy you didn't get, and once for the dirty energy you had to use instead. It is a Rube Goldberg machine of inefficiency. And who pays for it? The German grandma checking her mailbox, finding an electricity bill that has doubled in 3 years. We're halfway through the disaster. In the next part, we're going to talk about the heat pump fiasco that nearly toppled the government and the green reality check that shows why emissions are actually dropping. Spoiler, it's not good news. If you're enjoying this breakdown of economic chaos, hit that like button. It tells YouTube that people actually care about energy policy. And tell me in the comments, would you install a heat pump if the government forced you to pay $30,000 for it? Five. The heat pump rebellion. How to lose an election in one easy step. By 2023, the German government realized that shutting down nuclear and burning coal wasn't exactly great for their carbon footprint. [music] They needed new win. They needed to decarbonize your basement. Enter the Heights Gazettes, the heating law. The Green Party economic minister, Robert Hbeck, pushed through a law that effectively banned new oil and gas boilers starting in 2024. The replacement, heat pumps. Now, don't get me wrong, heat pumps are amazing technology. They are basically air conditioners running in reverse. They are super efficient. But there is a catch. They work best in modern, well-insulated houses with underfloor heating. Do you know what most German houses are? Old, drafty, built with [music] bricks thick enough to stop a tank, but terrible at holding heat. To make a heat pump work in a 1950s German house, you often need to rip up the floors, replace the radiators, and insulate the walls. The cost? It can easily run between $20,000 and $50,000. The government offered subsidies, sure, but the messaging was a disaster. It felt like a forced expropriation. Grandma, living on a pension in her paidoff house, was suddenly told she might have to take out a loan just to stay warm [music] next winter. The public reaction wasn't just anger, it was fury. The tabloid newspaper build ran headlines calling it the heat hammer. He hates hammer. Hbeck's approval ratings fell off a cliff. The farright party AFD [music] alternative for Germany surged in the polls largely by saying, [music] "We won't touch your boiler." It got so bad that the government nearly collapsed. They had to water down the law significantly, delaying the deadlines and creating massive loopholes. But the damage was done. The heat pump industry, which had ramped up production expecting a boom, actually saw sales crash in 2024 because everyone was confused and terrified. They panicked and bought brand new gas boilers before the ban kicked in, locking in fossil fuel usage for another 20 years. It was a masterclass in how not to do policy. Instead of incentivizing the transition, they tried to mandate it overnight, ignoring the economic reality of their own citizens. Six. The green mirage. Success by failure. Now, the German government will look at you and say, "But wait, our emissions are dropping. We hit our 2023 climate targets." And technically, they are right. In 2023, Germany's CO2 emissions dropped to the lowest level in 70 years. But why did they drop? Was it because of the amazing wind turbines? Was it the heat pumps? No. It was because the factories stopped running. Energy intensive production fell by nearly 20%. When you shut down steel mills, chemical plants, and paper factories, your emissions go down. Hooray! [music] You saved the planet by destroying your economy. This is the equivalent of losing weight by cutting off your leg. Yes, the scale says you are lighter, but you're also bleeding out on the bathroom floor. The head of Germany's audit office explicitly called this out. He said Germany is not on track for a sustainable transition. It is on track for an economic contraction that masquerades as climate success. And it gets [music] worse because Germany shut down its nuclear plants. Its electricity grid is now dirtier than its neighbor France. France gets 70% of its power from [music] nuclear. Their carbon intensity is around 50 g of CO2 per kilowan. Germany. Even on a good day, it hovers around 300 grin to 400 gr. [music] So when a German buys an electric car to save the planet, they are charging it with electricity that is [music] 6 to eight times dirtier than the electricity a French person uses. The green energy leader of Europe is actually one of the biggest polluters simply because they refuse to accept that nuclear energy is zero carbon. Seven, the 2025 reality check. Where are we now? So, here we are. It's late 2025. The German economy is stagnating. It was the only major G7 economy to shrink in 2023, and it barely moved in 2024. The German model, cheap energy in, highquality exports out, [music] is broken. The political landscape is fractured. The Green Party is fighting for its political life. The industries that made Germany rich are looking for exit strategies. And the world is watching. Developing nations like India and Vietnam are looking at Germany and saying, "Yeah, we're not doing that." They are building coal. They are building nuclear. They are prioritizing reliability and affordability over ideology. Germany wanted to be a role model and they succeeded. They became the perfect example of what not to do. They showed the world that you cannot run a modern industrial economy on intermittent weather dependent energy alone. At least not without a massive reliable base load backup. And if you destroy your clean backup nuclear before your new backup batteries or hydrogen is [music] ready, you fall off the bridge. Eight. Final thoughts. The moral of the story. Is there a way out? Maybe. Germany still has incredible engineers. They have deep pockets. There is talk of restarting some nuclear plants, though the technical hurdles are massive. Now, there is hope that hydrogen will eventually save the day. But the lesson for the rest of us is clear. Energy policy cannot be built on wishful thinking. It requires physics, math, and cold, hard economics. If you let ideology drive the bus, don't be surprised when you drive it off a cliff. Germany spent $500 billion to learn this lesson. Hopefully, the rest of us can learn it for free. [music] Thanks for watching.

I'll see you in the next

2. Why Invading the United States is IMPOSSIBLE (It’s Not the Army)




The year is 2030. Imagine you are the supreme commander of a hostile superpower. You have the ships, you have the soldiers, and you have the political will. You've just given the order to invade the United States of America. You aren't worried about the US Navy. Let's pretend for the sake of this thought experiment that the US military has magically vanished. Poof, gone. No aircraft carriers, no Reaper drones, no marines. Just the land, the people, and the infrastructure. You think this is going to be a walk in the park? You think you're going to plant your flag on the White House lawn within a month? My friend, you are about to walk into the greatest logistical meat grinder in human history. You see, the United [music] States isn't just a country. It is a geographically engineered fortress designed by nature to kill invaders. From the moment your boots touch the sand, if they even make it that far, you are fighting a battle against physics, economics, and a civilian population that makes the Vietkong look like a homeowners association dispute. [music] Today, we aren't talking about nukes or F-35s. We are looking at the terrifying economic and geographic reality of why the US is unconquerable. Buckle up, it's going to get messy. One, [music] the liquid walls of death, the tyranny of distance. Let's start with the most obvious problem, the one that usually kills your invasion before you even finish your morning coffee. The moes. To the east, you have the Atlantic Ocean. To the west, the Pacific. These aren't just bodies of water. They are logistical death sentences. If you are invading from Europe, you have to cross roughly 3,000 [music] to 4,000 m of open ocean just to get to the east coast. If you're coming from Asia, you're looking at nearly 6,000 to 7,000 m to hit California. Let's put that in perspective with some hard numbers. During World War II, for the Allies to invade Normandy, a trip across the English Channel that is roughly 20 to 100 m wide, depending on where you measure, it took years of planning, millions of tons of supplies, and the total economic output of three superpowers. That was for a gap you could almost swim across on a good day. Now, imagine doing that, but stretch the supply line to 6,000 mi. Let's assume you want to land a force capable of actually holding territory. Military doctrine generally suggests you need a ratio of force supremacy. But let's be conservative. Let's say you want to land 500,000 troops. That is a modest number to occupy a nation of 330 million people spanning 3.8 million square miles. You don't just ship the soldiers. You have to ship their food, their ammo, their medical supplies, and most importantly, their fuel. A modern armored division consumes hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel per day. To support an invasion force across the Pacific, you would need a bridge of ships so dense you could almost walk on it. And here is the dark comedy of it all. The United States has no nearby staging grounds. In most invasions, you build up forces in a neighboring country. Germany used France to hit Britain or tried to. The US used Britain to hit Germany. The US used Saudi Arabia to hit Iraq. Who are you going to use to hit the US? If you try to stage in Hawaii, you're still 2,500 m from the mainland. That's like staging in London to invade Iraq. It doesn't help you. The sheer volume of shipping required to move a credible invasion force across the Atlantic or Pacific would be visible from space. It would take months to assemble. There is no surprise attack here. You aren't sneaking up on America. The moment you start loading those ships, the US economy, which we will get to later, shifts into total war mode. By the time your first ship reaches the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, of the United States, your soldiers will have been at sea for weeks. They are seasick, their muscles have atrophied from confinement, [music] and they are eating MREs. And what are they greeted with? Not a welcome mat. They are greeted by the reality that the US coastlines are not designed for easy access. The west coast of the United States is largely rocky cliffs and treacherous currents with very few viable deep water ports suitable for offloading heavy armor. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, that's about it. These are bottlenecks. If the defenders scuttle a few cargo ships in the entrance to the port of Long Beach or destroy the cranes, which they absolutely would do, you're stuck offloading tanks onto a beach while taking fire. On the east coast, the water is shallow, the swamps are treacherous. We'll get to the south later. And the urbanization is so dense that you're fighting in a concrete jungle the second you step off the boat. Ottovon Bismar, the Iron Chancellor of Germany, once famously said or is attributed to have said, "God has a special providence for fools, drunkards, and the United States of America." He was right. Geography is the first line of defense, and for the US, geography is a serial killer. Hey, quick pause. If you're enjoying this descent into hypothetical madness, smash that subscribe button. We cover the dark side of economics and history every week. Also, let me know in the comments if you had to pick a landing spot for an invasion, where would you choose? Florida, California, Texas. Spoiler, Texas is a suicide mission. Let's keep going. Two. The neighborhood from hell, Canada, and Mexico. Okay, so the oceans are a no-go. You're smart. You're a tactical genius. You decide, I won't go by sea directly. I'll land in Canada or Mexico and drive in. Congratulations. You have just played yourself. Let's start with the northern approach, Canada. You land in Canada. Great. Welcome to the Canadian Shield. If you aren't familiar with geology, the Canadian Shield is basically millions of square miles of exposed precamrian ignous rock swamps, thousands of lakes, and dense freezing forests. It is one of the most inhospitable terrains on Earth for mechanized warfare. There are very few roads that go north to south in a capacity that can support heavy armor columns. The infrastructure just isn't there because nobody lives there. It's too cold and the ground is too hard. If you land in Vancouver to come down the west coast, you're funneled into the Cascade Mountains. You're forced into narrow choke points where a handful of defenders with explosives can bury your entire convoy under a landslide. If you land in the east, say Halifax or Montreal, you have to march through the Appalachians and the dense forests of New England during winter. And remember, General Winter saved Russia from Napoleon and Hitler. Well, North American winters are no joke either. Your supply lines will freeze. Your tanks will bog down in the spring. And you are doing all of this while trying to occupy a territory, Canada, that is arguably just as culturally hostile to you as the US. Okay, so north is out. Let's go south. Let's land in Mexico and drive up. Welcome to the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. This isn't just hot sand. This is terrain that kills people who try to walk across it with a backpack, let alone an army trying to move heavy equipment. It is arid, brutal, and lacks water sources. But the terrain isn't even your biggest problem here. It's the logistics of the border. The US Mexico border is roughly 2,000 mi long, but where can you actually drive a tank across? Not many places. You have the Rio Grand acting as a natural moat for a huge chunk of it. You have vast stretches of unpaved wilderness. And once you cross, you aren't in the heartland of America. You're in the American Southwest. You're in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. We will talk about the people later, but purely from a logistical standpoint, the distances here are mind-boggling. If you cross the border at El Paso, you're still 1/400 miles from Chicago. You're 1 1700 m from Washington DC. You have to drag your supply lines across thousands of miles of open desert, exposed to the elements with very little local infrastructure to scavenge. There are no dense clusters of cities to pillage for supplies until you hit the major metro areas, which are hundreds of miles apart. Furthermore, consider the rail gauge problem. While North American rail gauges are standardized standard gauge, the rail infrastructure in Mexico while improving is not integrated or maintained to the level required to support the movement of millions of tons of military hardware rapidly northwards. You would be relying on trucks and trucks need gas. Where are you getting the gas? The US is the world's largest oil producer. If they scorch the earth, blow the refineries in Texas, cap the wells in the Perian Basin, you're driving into a desert with no gas stations. Historically, invasions fail because of overextended supply lines. Napoleon in Russia, the Nazis in Russia, the US in Vietnam, conceptually different, but supply heavy. Invading the US through Mexico or Canada creates the longest, most vulnerable supply lines in the history of warfare. You would need to occupy and pacify Canada or Mexico first, which would take [music] years, giving the US ample time to turn the border into a militarized zone that would make the Majinino line look like a picket fence. You're trapped on the periphery. The geography creates a kill box. You can get to the continent maybe, but you cannot get into the vital organs of the country. Three, the geographical kill zones, the mountains. Let's say you achieve the impossible. You made it across the ocean. You bypass the Canadian forests and the Mexican deserts. You've established a beach head on the east or west coast. You pat yourself on the back. The hard part is over. You tell your generals. Wrong. The hard part hasn't even started. Now you have to deal with the shields. If you landed on the west coast, look east. Do you see that massive wall of jagged rock stretching from Canada to New Mexico? That is the Rocky Mountains. [music] It is 3,000 mi long and at its widest points over 300 m wide. The peaks soar over 14,000 ft. There are very few major passes and the ones that exist like Interstate 70 through Colorado are engineering marvels that traverse steep canyons, tunnels, and bridges. In a defensive war, the US military or what's left of the local resistance doesn't need to fight you in the open. They just need to blow the Eisenhower tunnel. They just need to drop the bridges in Glenwood Canyon. Suddenly, your multi-billion dollar invasion force is stuck in a parking lot on the I70, surrounded by vertical cliffs. And you know who is up on those cliffs. Locals with hunting rifles that can take the head off a coin from 500 yd away. You aren't fighting a conventional war here. You're fighting Afghanistan on steroids. The Soviets spent a decade trying to pacify the mountains of Afghanistan with a fraction of the population and weaponry. The Rockies are bigger, the weather is more erratic, and the defenders are better armed. If you try to cross the Rockies, your supply trucks will burn. Your tanks will slide off icy cliffs. You will be bled dry in the passes. Okay, you say. West Coast is a trap. I'll invade the East Coast. Washington DC, New York, Boston. Great choice. You capture the coastal cities. You take Manhattan. Good luck holding it, but let's pretend. Now you want to push inland to the heartland where the food and energy are. Welcome to the Appalachians. While they aren't as tall as the Rockies, the Appalachians are a dense foliage covered nightmare for armored vehicles. They run from Alabama all the way up to Maine. They create a natural barrier between the coast and the Midwest. Historically, this is where empires go to die. During the 18th century, the British Empire, the greatest military force on Earth, couldn't effectively project power these mountains. They got bogged down in the woods, ambushed by irregulars who knew every creek and ravine. The geography forces you onto predictable roads. Predictable roads mean IEDs, improvised explosive devices. If you're driving a convoy through West Virginia or Kentucky, you are in a literal bowl. The roads wind through the valleys. The high ground is everywhere, covered in dense forest. You cannot see the enemy, but they can see you. Every bridge is a choke [music] point. Every tunnel is a potential tomb. And unlike the deserts of Iraq, where you can see for miles, here the engagement distance is often less than 100 m. You can't use your fancy air support effectively if you can't see through the tree canopy. You're back to close quarters infantry fighting against people who have been hunting in these woods since they were 6 years old. The geography of the United States effectively creates a citadel in the middle of the continent, the Mississippi Basin, protected by two massive mountain ranges. To get to the prize, you have to siege the castle walls, and the walls are 10,000 ft high and shooting back at you. For the behind every blade of grass problem, civilian insurgency, let's stop talking about rocks and dirt. Let's talk about the scariest variable in this entire equation, the people. There is a potentially apocryphal quote attributed to the Japanese Admiral Isuraku Yamamoto during Drathun. You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass. Whether he actually said it or not doesn't matter. The math makes it true. Let's look at the numbers because they are genuinely hard to comprehend if you are not American. According to the Small Arms Survey, there are roughly 393 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States. That was the estimate a few years ago. The number is likely well over 400 million now. [music] There are only about 335 million people in the country. Do the math. That is more than one gun for every man, woman, child, and infant. But we know babies aren't packing heat. Usually, the guns are concentrated. About 40 50% of households admit to owning a gun. But it's not just pistols and shotguns. We're talking about AR-15s, high-powered precision hunting rifles, and millions of rounds of ammunition. In the state of Wisconsin alone, during the deer hunting season, roughly 600,000 hunters head into the woods. Let that sink in. If the Wisconsin deer hunters were an army, they would be the eighth largest standing army in the world. Bigger than the active duty military of France, bigger than Germany, bigger than Iran. And that is just one state. And those are just the registered hunters. Now, you might be thinking, "But those are civilians. They aren't trained soldiers. My invasion force has tanks. Sure, but let's look at modern warfare in Vietnam, in Afghanistan, in Iraq. How well did heavy armor fare against a decentralized, motivated insurgency armed with small arms and homemade explosives? Not well. And those insurgents were often working with rusty AK-47s and limited ammo. An American insurgency would be the most well-unded, wellequipped guerrilla force in human history. You aren't just fighting rebels. You're fighting combat veterans. The US has been at war for most of the last 20 years. There are roughly 18 million veterans living in the United States. Many of them have combat experience. They know how to make IEDs. They know how to set up ambushes. They know logistics, communications, and squad tactics. Imagine you're occupying a small town in Missouri. You have your checkpoint set up. You think you're safe. Suddenly, your supply truck hits a pressure plate. A drone bought off Amazon for $50 and rigged with a pipe bomb drops a payload on your commander's jeep. Snipers engage you from three different directions using thermal optics they bought at a sporting goods store. You try to return fire, but they melt away into the suburbs, into the cornfields, into the woods. This isn't a war where you take the capital and the country surrenders. The US is a federation of states. If you take Washington DC, Texas doesn't care. Texas laughs at you. In fact, taking DC might just make the rest of the country fight harder. There is no head of the snake to cut off. The resistance would be hyper local. Every county, every town, every neighborhood becomes a fortress. You would need a ratio of roughly 20 soldiers for every 1,000 civilians to effectively police a hostile population. For a country of 330 million, you would need an occupation force of 6.6 million soldiers. The entire active duty Chinese military is about 2 million. The entire active duty Russian military pre2022 was around 1 million. You literally do not have enough humans to occupy the United States. You can't stand on every street corner and the moment you turn your back, that blade of grass is going to take a shot. I want to hear from the Americans watching this. If an invasion force landed in your state tomorrow, what is the local terrain feature that would ruin their day? The swamps, the snow, the traffic on the 405? Let me know in the comments below. Five, the logistical black hole internal infrastructure. Okay, so the people are shooting at you, the mountains are blocking you, and the oceans are isolating you. But surely if you capture the infrastructure, you can use it against them, right? Here is the irony. The US infrastructure is designed for commerce, not for conquest. The United States is massive. We talked about distance before, but let's talk about it in terms of time. Driving from New York to Los Angeles takes roughly 41 hours of non-stop driving. That is assuming no traffic, no blown bridges, and no ambushes. In a war zone, that trip could take months. The US relies heavily on its interstate highway system. It's a marvel of engineering. But it has a fatal flaw for an invader. Bridges. There are over 600,000 bridges in the United States. If the US defenders decide to execute a scorched earth policy, which they would, they don't need to destroy every road, they just need to drop the key bridges over the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Ohio rivers. The Mississippi River Basin is the jugular vein of the continent. It splits the country in half. If you blow the bridges, the east and west are severed. For the US, this is manageable. Painful, but manageable because they have the barges and the boats to move supplies on the river. For you, the invader, you're stuck on the bank. You have to build pontoon bridges across a river that is a mile wide in some places with strong currents while being shot at. And then there is the rail network. The US has the best freight rail system in the world. But it is privately owned and highly complex. If the operators sabotage the switching stations or derail locomotives and key tunnels, the entire network freezes. You can't just bring your own trains. The scale is too big. You're forced to rely on trucks. And as we mentioned earlier, trucks need fuel. [music] The US has a strategic petroleum reserve. They have refineries. But in an invasion scenario, those refineries will be burning. The pipelines will be shut off. You will be sitting in the middle of Kansas, 1,000 m from the ocean with an empty tank, a broken bridge ahead of you, and an angry farmer behind you. This is the logistical black hole. The further you push in, the weaker you get. The further you push in, the stronger the resistance gets because they are fighting on their home turf close to their own stockpiles. You're stretching a rubber band until it snaps. And when it snaps, it snaps right in your face. Six. The economic suicide pill mutually assured depression. Let's step away from the battlefield for a second. Let's assume you are a wizard. You have bypassed the navy, climbed the mountains, dodged the rednecks with AR-15s, and somehow kept your tanks fueled. You're actually winning the ground war. Congratulations. You have just triggered the economic apocalypse. And the victim isn't just the United States. It's you. This is the economic suicide pill. The United States is not just a participant in the global economy. In many ways, it is the operating system of the global economy. First, let's talk about the US dollar. It is the world's primary reserve currency. Roughly 60% of all foreign exchange reserves held by central banks are in USD. Most global trade, oil, gold, commodities, is priced in dollars. If you destabilize the US government to the point of collapse, the dollar becomes worthless. Good, you say. I hate the dollar. Think again. If the dollar hits zero, trillions of dollars of wealth sitting in your country's banks vanish overnight. Your own currency, which is likely pegged to or backed by assets valued in dollars, free falls. Global trade stops because nobody knows what anything is worth anymore. You aren't just invading a country. You're blowing up the bank where you keep your own life savings. Second, let's talk about tech and intellectual property. Where are your servers? Where is your cloud data? AWS, Amazon, Azure, Microsoft, Google Cloud. The physical infrastructure for the internet is heavily concentrated in the US. If you start bombing data centers in Virginia, where a massive chunk of the world's internet traffic flows, you don't just cut off Netflix for Americans. You crash your own banking software. You crash your own military communications. You blind your own satellites. And then there is the brain drain. In the event of an invasion, the US wouldn't just leave their tech for you to steal. [music] They would execute Operation Paperclip in reverse. The smartest engineers, the nuclear scientists, the AI researchers, they're getting on planes or submarines and fleeing to Allied nations. They're taking the encryption keys, the blueprints and the source code with them. You conquer Silicon Valley and what you find empty buildings and bricked servers. The value isn't in the land, it's in the people and the systems. And those systems have poison pills built in. By invading the US, you're essentially shooting the pilot of the plane you're also a passenger on. The crash won't just kill the Americans, it will send your own nation back to the Stone Age. Seven, the administrative nightmare, the ungovernable map. Finally, let's talk about the most boring yet most effective defense mechanism of all, federalism and bureaucracy. You think invading is hard? Try governing. The United [music] States is not a monolith. It is 50 separate countries in a trench coat masquerading as a nation. In many centralized countries, if you capture the capital and kill the dictator, the war is over. The police take orders from the new boss. The army stands down. In the US, the president has surprisingly limited power over day-to-day life in the states. The governors hold the keys to the National Guard. The county sheriffs hold the keys to local enforcement. There are over 3,000 counties in the United States. Each one has its own sheriff, its own police force, its own local laws, and its own stubborn pride. If you capture Washington DC, the governor of Texas doesn't surrender. He probably declares himself the president of the Republic of Texas and mobilizes the Texas State Guard. The governor of California does the same. You don't have to defeat one government. You have to defeat 51 governments, federal 50 states, plus thousands of local jurisdictions. And let's not forget the sheer stubbornness of the American psyche. We are talking about a culture founded on the idea of telling the government to go to hell. Americans argue with their own government over parking tickets. They protest their own laws. How do you think they will react to a foreign occupier telling them what to do? You will face a campaign of malicious compliance, sabotage, strikes, and civil disobedience on a scale never before seen. The electrical grid will mysteriously fail every time you try to broadcast propaganda. The water supplies will be contaminated. The roads will be blocked by accidents. You will spend more money trying to police the population than you could ever hope to extract in resources. It is a negative sum game. The longer you stay, the poorer you get. Final thoughts, the unconquerable fortress. So, let's recap your invasion plan. One, the oceans. You have to cross thousands of miles of water vulnerable to submarines and drones just to get to the fight. Two, the neighbors. You have to drag your supply lines through the frozen hell of Canada or the scorching deserts of Mexico. Three, the geography. You have to push tanks through the Rockies and the Appalachians, which are basically natural kill zones. Four, the people. You have to occupy a nation where grandmother's own shotguns and combat veterans are hiding in every suburb. Five, [music] the logistics. You have to maintain supply lines across a continent designed to be broken [music] with bridges that will be destroyed before you even see them. Six, the economy. If you win, you crash the global economy and destroy your own wealth. Invading the United States is not a military operation. It is a suicide note. It is a logistical impossibility wrapped in a geographical nightmare, deep fried in economic ruin. The United States doesn't need a massive standing army to remain uninvaded. The land itself does the heavy lifting. The Atlantic and Pacific are the walls. The Rockies and Appalachians are the towers. And the people, they are the garrison that never sleeps. So to any aspiring superpowers watching this video, don't do it. Not because you're nice. Not because of international law, but because you will lose, and you will lose badly. That's the reality of American geography. [music] It is the ultimate cheat code in the game of civilization.

3. Why France is POORER Than You Think (The Economic Truth)


Imagine you've just landed at Charl de Gaul airport. [music] You're expecting the fantasy. You're expecting the France of Louis Vuitton ads, endless cafe terraces, and a work life balance that makes American capitalism look like a penal colony. You think you're entering a wealthy superpower. But you're wrong. You're stepping into a country that is quietly, politely, and steadily going broke. A country where the middle class is evaporating. Where the most ambitious young people are fleeing. and where the government is sitting on a debt bomb that makes Italy look fiscally responsible. The croissants are still good, but the economics, they're terrifying. Welcome to the reality of the French decline. Here are seven reasons why France is poorer than you think. One, the smodization of the soul. Let's play a game. Imagine you're a young French professional. You did everything right. You suffered through the classes preparer. You got your master's degree. You speak decent English. You land a good job in a midsize city like Leon or Bordeaux. You open your first paycheck and you stare at it. €940. That's the net monthly median salary in France as of 2024. That means half the population earns less than that. Now compare that to your friend who didn't go to college. Maybe they work as a cashier or a cleaner or an unqualified server. They're on the ESM, the Salair minimum interprofessional dequants, the minimum wage. As of 2024, the net smick is around €1,400. Do you see the problem? The gap between surviving and middle class is less than €550 a month. In the US, the gap between a minimum wage worker and a median earner is massive. In France, it's a rounding error. This phenomenon has a name. Economists call it smikodization. It's the great flattening. Over the last 20 years, France has essentially compressed its wage structure into a pancake. Because the cost of labor is so high for companies, we'll get to the taxes later, oh boy, will we. Employers simply cannot afford to give raises. So, when the government raises the minimum wage to keep up with inflation, which they do aggressively, the bottom floor rises, but the ceiling stays where it is. The result, the floor is eating the room. Decades ago, only a small percentage of French workers were on minimum wage. Today, it's over 17% of the workforce. And for millions more, they are hovering just a few euros above it. Imagine the psychological toll of that. You study for 5 years, you take on stress, you manage a team, and you take home barely more than the guy stocking shelves. Why bother working harder? Why bother innovating? This isn't just an economic statistic. It's a motivation killer. It turns the entire country into a participation trophy where the prize is barely being able to afford rent. Speaking of rent, if you think that €900 goes far because healthcare is free, let me introduce you to the French real estate market. In Paris, a decent studio apartment, not a palace, a box where you can touch the fridge from your bed costs between two €200 and €1,500 a month. Do the math. On a median salary, living in the capital is mathematically impossible without roommates or rich parents. You aren't living in Paris, you are camping in it. Two, the museum economy de-industrialization. If you drive 2 hours north of the luxury boutiques of Paris, you enter a different world. This is the rust belt of France, the uda France, the grandest. This is where the ghost of French industry lives. You see, we have this image of France as a powerhouse. We think of Airbus, nuclear power plants, and high-speed trains. And yes, those exist. But they are the remnants of a glorious past, not the indicators of a vibrant present. Here is the brutal truth. France doesn't make things anymore. Look at the numbers. Manufacturing now accounts for barely 10% of France's GDP. Compare that to Germany, where it's nearly double that, [music] or Italy, or even Poland. France has de-industrialized faster and harder than almost any other western nation. Why? Because for 40 years, French policy was obsessed with the idea of a post-industrial society. The geniuses in Paris decided that factories were dirty and old-fashioned. They wanted France to be a nation of consultants, designers, and luxury brand managers. They bet everything on services and tourism. [music] They bet on becoming the museum of the world, and it worked for the tourists. France is the number one tourist destination on Earth. But you can't build a superpower on waiters and tour guides. The consequences are devastating. When you lose factories, you lose the high-paying bluecollar jobs that sustain the middle class in rural areas. When those jobs go to Poland or China, the towns die, the bakery closes, the school shrinks, the doctor retires and isn't replaced. This is the fuel for the political rage you see on the news. When you see the yellow vests, Gilelay's jeorns, burning toll booths, they aren't doing it because they hate Macron or love violence. They're doing it because they live in these peripheral ghost towns where the only economic activity left is a supermarket and an Amazon warehouse. They are the casualties of the museum economy. While Paris sells €3,000 handbags to American tourists, the rest of the country is fighting over crumbs. And here is the kicker. During the COVID pandemic, France realized in a panic that it didn't even have the capacity to manufacture paracetamol. The country that invented the vaccine, pastor, anyone, had to beg India and China for basic painkillers. That is the reality of a country that forgot how to build. Hey, quick pause. If you're realizing that your dream of moving to a shadow might need a budget adjustment, hit that subscribe button. We dig into the dark side of the global economy every week. and let me know in the comments. Would you rather earn €5,000 in a country with no healthare or boss €500 in a country where it's free? I'm genuinely curious. Three, the debt bomb no one talks about. Let's talk about the national credit card. You might hear about the US debt crisis a lot, but the US has a printing press and the world's reserve currency. France does not. France uses the euro. It cannot print its way out of trouble. It relies on the kindness of strangers, specifically bond markets and German patients. In 2024, France's public debt hit 113% of GDP. To put that in perspective, the European Union rules, the famous must criteria, say you're supposed to keep debt under 60%. [music] France hasn't seen 60% since the internet was invented. Here is a fun, terrifying fact. France has not passed a balanced government budget since 1974. For 50 years, half a century, the French government has spent more than it earned. Every single year, left-wing governments, right-wing governments, centrists, it doesn't matter. The addiction to spending is bipartisan. Where does the money go? It's not going into infrastructure. Bridges are crumbling. It's not going into the military. We're relying on NATO. It's going into social protection. France spends a staggering 32% to 34% of its GDP on social spending. That is the highest in the world, higher than Sweden, higher than Denmark. It is a welfare state on steroids. [music] Now, don't get me wrong, it's nice to have a safety net. It's great that no one dies in the street from a lack of insulin, but this level of spending is mathematically unsustainable when your economy isn't growing. You're paying for a Rolls-Royce welfare state with a pujo economy. And the bill is coming due in 2024. The interest payments on the French debt alone became one of the largest budget items soon to eclipse the education budget. Think about that. France will spend more paying off past mistakes than it spends educating its future children. If that doesn't scream poorer than you think, I don't know what does. Four, the great salary illusion tax hellscape. If there is one thing France is world champion at, beating even Brazil in football, it is taxation. Let's go back to that HR office from earlier. Remember the 1740 paycheck. To get that money into your bank account, a financial murder scene had to take place first. Here is how it works. And if you are American, sit down because this might induce vertigo. Let's say a company wants to hire you for a decent mid-level job. They are willing to spend €60,000 a year on you. That is the super brute, the [music] total cost to the employer. First, the government takes a massive bite called employer contributions. Poof, gone. Now, your gross salary, the number written on your contract, is about €43,000. But wait, you don't get €43,000. Now, the government takes employee contributions for social security, retirement, unemployment, etc. Another huge bite. Now you're left with your net salary, roughly €33,000. But we aren't done because now you have to pay income tax on that net salary. By the time the money actually hits your pocket to buy groceries, [music] nearly 50% of what your employer paid for your labor has vanished into the state coffers. France has the highest tax burden in the OECD. The government confiscates about 45 48% of the entire country's GDP in taxes and social charges every year. This creates a vicious cycle of poverty. Companies can't afford to pay high net salaries because the taxes on top are astronomical. Employees have no disposable income to spend. So the local economy stagnates. The government sees the stagnation and says, "We need more money to fix this." And raises taxes again. It's an economic boa constrictor. It squeezes slowly and you don't realize you're suffocating until you try to save money at the end of the month and realize you can't. And God help you if you try to get rich. France has a cultural allergy to wealth. We literally had a solidarity tax on wealth, ESF, for years that taxed you just for having assets, regardless of your income. It scared away thousands of millionaires. Macron replaced it with a real estate wealth tax, but the message remains. Success is suspicious. Please apologize for it by giving us half. Five. A Ponzi scheme called retirement. You probably saw the news in 2023. Paris was burning. Garbage was piled high in the streets. Riot police were charging through tear gas. Why was it a war? A coup? No. The government proposed raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. To the rest of the world, this looked insane. In Germany, the retirement age is heading to 67. In the UK and US, it's similar, but in France, asking people to work two more years was treated like a human rights violation. But here is the dark reality those protesters didn't want to admit. The French pension system is a demographic Ponzi scheme. It is a pay as you go system. That means the money taken from your paycheck today isn't being saved for your retirement. It is being wired directly to a retiree right now. You are paying for your grandma's vacation in Nice. This system works great when you have four workers for every one retiree. That was France in the 1960s. Today, [music] it's roughly 1.7 workers for every one retiree and dropping. France is getting old. The baby boomers are retiring on mass and the birth rate while higher than the rest of Europe is not high enough to replace them. So you have a shrinking pool of young underpaid workers. Remember the smikodization trying to support a growing army of retirees who are living longer than ever. The math is brutal. It simply does not work. The system is bleeding billions of euros a year. To plug the hole, the government has two choices. One, cut pensions, political [music] suicide. Two, raise the retirement age. Political suicide, but slightly slower. So, the country is stuck in a paralyzed state of denial. The young know they will probably never see a full pension. Yet, they are taxed to death to pay for the old. It is an intergenerational robbery that is making the working population poorer every single day. Six. The great brain drain. Exodus of the elite. If you walk into a Goldman Sachs office in London, a Google office in Zurich, or a research lab in Montreal, look at the badges. You will see a shocking number of French names. France produces brilliant minds. [music] The education system, specifically the elite Gronzole, is fantastic at churning out worldclass engineers, mathematicians, and financiers. But France cannot keep them. This is the brain drain and it is bleeding the country dry of its most valuable resource, human capital. Imagine you're a top tier AI researcher. Option A, stay in Paris, earn $45,000 a year, pay 50% taxes, struggle to rent a 30 m apartment, deal with a gloomy hierarchy where you wait 15 years for a promotion. Option B, move to California or Switzerland, earn $150,000 a year, pay lower taxes, live in a house, lead a team immediately. It's not a hard choice. Estimates suggest that between 2.5 and 3 million French citizens live abroad. But it's not a random sample. These are the risktakers, the entrepreneurs, the scientists. When the smartest people leave, innovation leaves with them. This is why there is no French Google or French Amazon. There are very few French tech giants created in the last 20 years. The founders left. They built Snowflake in the US. They built Madna. The CEO is French in the US. France is effectively subsidizing the rest of the world. The French taxpayer pays for the expensive education of these geniuses. And then the US or UK economy reaps the profits of their labor. [music] It creates a country that feels stagnant. A country where the ambition is capped. If you stay, you accept the ceiling. If you want to break through, you buy a plane ticket. It's getting a bit depressing, isn't it? But stick with me because the final point ties this all together into something you see every day but never noticed. Before we get there, if you are French and watching this from London or New York, comment below. Tell us why you left. I bet it's reason number four. Seven, the collapse of public services. But wait, you argue. At least they have free healthcare. At least the trains are fast. Here is the saddest part of the decline. The free stuff is breaking. For decades, [music] the unspoken contract in France was, "We take half your money, but we give you worldclass services. That contract is void." Visit a French emergency room today. You might wait 10, 12, sometimes 20 hours. There are medical deserts in rural France where you cannot find a GP to save your life. Doctors are retiring. And the quotota system, numerous clauses, kept the number of new doctors artificially low for decades. Look at the education system. French students used to be among the best in math. In the latest piece of rankings, France has dropped to the middle of the pack [music] with inequality skyrocketing. Teachers are underpaid and demoralized, leading to a recruitment crisis where the government is hiring unqualified staff just to put warm bodies in classrooms. Look at the justice system. [music] It is notoriously slow and underfunded. The tragedy is that the French are still paying luxury prices, high taxes, but receiving budget service. When the public [music] sector fails, those with money opt out. They send their kids to private schools. They go to private clinics. They use private security. This creates a two-tier society. The rich insulate themselves from the decline while the poor and the middle class are left with crumbling infrastructure. The egalite carved onto the front of the town halls is starting to look less like a promise and more like a cruel joke. Eight. The world champions of pessimism. If economics is the hardware of a country, psychology is the software and France's software is glitching. You might think the most pessimistic people in the world live in war zones or places with extreme poverty. You'd be wrong. Year after year, global polls like BVA Gallup show that the French are the most pessimistic people on Earth, often ranking lower than citizens of Iraq, Afghanistan, or Colombia regarding their view of the future. This is the hidden tax on the French economy, depression. Why is a country with five week paid vacations, the best cheese in the world, and high-speed trains so miserable? It comes down to the gap between expectation and reality. The French are raised on the myth of Lagon National Nassion. They grow up hearing about Napoleon, de Gaul, the Enlightenment, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They are told they are the center of the civilized world. But when they look out the window, they see a country that is shrinking in influence. They see a language that is being replaced by English or globish in business. They see their culture being Netflix-ized. This creates a collective cognitive dissonance. It's like a fading [music] aristocrat who still lives in the castle, but can't afford to heat it. They wear the velvet robes, but they're shivering. This pessimism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumers don't spend because they fear the future. Saving rates in France are unusually high. Entrepreneurs don't start businesses because they fear failure is permanent. In France, bankruptcy is a social scarlet letter, unlike in the US where it's a badge of honor. Voters embrace radicalism because they feel the system is rigged against them. This psychological weight is perhaps the hardest thing to fix. You can change a tax law in a week. You cannot change a national mood in a decade. France is currently trapped in a cycle of declinism and obsession with its own decline that makes it almost impossible to rally the country for the painful reforms it actually needs. Nine. The canary in the coal mine for the west. Now, before you sit back in your chair in Chicago, London, or Toronto and laugh at the French, let me give you a warning. France is not an anomaly. It is a time machine. France is showing you exactly what happens when a wealthy western democracy runs out of road. It is the test case for a specific type of economic disease that is coming for everyone else. Look at the symptoms. One, aging population. France hit the demographic wall first. The US is 10 years behind. Two, de-industrialization. France gutted its factories faster, but the US rust belt is telling the same story. Three, debt addiction. France's 110% debt to GDP is shocking, but the US is racing to catch up, running trillion dollar deficits in peace time. Four, political polarization. The collapse of the centrist parties in France. Socialists and Republicans are basically dead. And the rise of the extremes, Le Pen versus the far-left is a preview of the polarization tearing apart the US and UK. France is the laboratory. It is trying to maintain a 20th century standard of living with 21st century demographics and 19th century industrial thinking. If France collapses, if the bond vigilantes finally attack French debt, if the EU has to bail out the second largest economy in Europe, it won't just be a French problem. It will be a global financial cataclysm. It will be 2008 but with better wine and angrier rioters. So when you look at France, don't just see a poor country. See a warning flare. Final thoughts. So is France doomed? Is it destined to become a sprawling open air museum where tourists throw coins at the natives? Not necessarily. France has bounced back before. This is a country that survived the Hundred Years War, the Revolution, two world wars, and occupation. There is a resilience in the French character, a stubbornness that shouldn't be underestimated. There are signs of life. The tech scene in Paris, Station F, is growing. There is a generation of young French people who are tired of the old dogmas who want to work, build, and disrupt. They are fighting against the gravity of the system, but the math is relentless. The debt is real. The aging is real. The poverty of the middle class is real. France is currently living on borrowed time and borrowed money. The illusion of wealth is maintained by debt and the social peace is maintained by spending money the state doesn't have. The question is not if the correction is coming. The question is when. And for you, the lesson is simple. Don't let the postcard fool you. Don't let the luxury brands distract you. And most importantly, look at your own country's balance sheet because the French disease is contagious and you might already be infected. If you want to understand who might fall next, you need to watch our upcoming video on why Germany is dying quietly, the way Forward. It makes the French situation look like a picnic. And if you learned something today, if I shattered your Emily and Paris fantasy just a little bit, hit that like button. It helps the algorithm more than a government subsidy.

4. Why Europe’s Economy is Collapsing (The 6 Fatal Wounds)

The year is 2035. You're an American tourist visiting Europe. You start your morning with a cross in Paris, take a hyperloop to Rome for lunch, and finish with a beer in Berlin. It is beautiful. The architecture is stunning. The history is palpable, but something feels off. The streets are clean, but quiet. The cafes are full, but mostly with gray hair. And when you try to buy a souvenir, you realize the shop isn't owned by a local. In fact, entire city blocks, the ports, and the energy grid are owned by foreign conglomerates. You aren't walking through a superpower anymore. You're walking through the world's most expensive [music] open air museum. Back in 2008, the economies of the European Union and the United States were roughly the same size. In fact, Europe was slightly bigger. They were economic twins. Fast forward to today, the twins have separated. While the American economy rocketed to over $27 trillion, Europe has largely stagnated, barely crawling past 17 trillion, the gap between them is now so large, it's effectively the size of the entire Japanese economy. How did a continent with the highest standard of living, the best healthcare, and the deepest history fall so far so fast? Spoiler alert, it wasn't an accident. It was a suicide. Over the next 30 minutes, we're going to dissect the six fatal wounds that are bleeding Europe dry. From the factories of Germany going dark to the empty nurseries of Italy to the regulatory strangle hold in Brussels. Welcome to the decline of the old world. If you think I'm being dramatic, just look at the numbers. Since 2008, the US economy grew by 87%. The EU just 13%. If this trend continues, the average European in 2050 will be poorer than the average resident of Mississippi. Yeah, [music] let that sink in. So, grab your espresso while you can still [music] afford it. And let's look at the first nail in the coffin. One, the great de-industrialization, the German engine stalls. For decades, the economic heart of Europe was Germany. And the heart of Germany was heavy industry, cars, chemicals, machines, the stuff that makes the world turn. The formula for German success was simple, arguably brilliant, and [music] deeply cynical. Use American security to stay safe. Use Chinese demand to sell cars. And most importantly, use cheap Russian gas to power the factories. It worked until it didn't. When the Nordstream pipelines blew up, [music] both literally and metaphorically, the German business model evaporated overnight. Let's talk about BASF. They are the largest chemical producer in the world. They make the stuff that goes into your toothpaste, your sneakers, your car, and your medicine. Their headquarters in Ludvik Hen is basically a city within a city. In 2024, BSF made a decision that should have terrified every politician in Berlin. They decided to shut down major production lines in Germany. Why? Because making chemicals requires massive amounts of energy. And thanks to the loss of Russian gas and a frantic botch transition to green energy, electricity prices in Germany hit levels that make doing business mathematically impossible. Instead of staying in Germany, BSF is dropping 10 billion to build a new mega site in Janzang, China. Think about the irony here. Germany, a country that prides itself on human rights and environmental standards, is forcing its own companies to move to China, a country that burns coal like it's going out of style just to stay solvent. This isn't just BASF. In December 2024, German industrial production dropped to its lowest level since the 2020 lockdowns. We are seeing the hollowing out of European industry. And here is where the dark humor kicks in. Germany shut down its last three nuclear power plants in April 2023 at the height of an energy crisis. [music] They turned off clean, reliable base load power. So, what did they do to keep the lights on? They reactivated coal plants. They're literally digging up villages to mine brown coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel in existence, to make up for the nuclear plants they shut down to save the environment. You cannot make this stuff up. But wait, [music] I hear you say, can't they just switch to high-tech services like the US? Well, they could if they hadn't regulated their tech sector into a coma, which we will get to in a minute. But for now, understand this. Europe built its wealth on making things. And right now, the signs on the factory doors are flipping from will to closed. Two, the demographic death spiral, the empty cribs. If the factories closing down as a heart attack, this next problem is a slow growing cancer. It's quieter, but it's 100% fatal if untreated. Let's take a trip to Italy. Beautiful food, great wine, and absolutely no babies. In 2024, Italy's birth rate hit a historic low of 1.18 children per woman. To put that in perspective, a population needs a rate of 2.1 just to replace itself. Anything below 1.5 is considered a demographic emergency. At 1.18, you're looking at mathematical extinction. Imagine you're a 25-year-old Italian named Matteo. You just graduated. You have a degree, but you can't find a job because the economy is stagnant. Coint You live with your parents because rent is insane. But here is the kicker. The Italian [music] state expects you, Matteo, to pay for the pensions of the massive generation of retirees above you. Europe's pension systems are largely pay as you go. That means there is no vault of gold where your grandma's money is stored. The money grandma gets this month comes directly out of Matteo's paycheck this month. In the 1960s, there were four workers for every retiree. It was easy. The burden was light. By 2050, in countries like Italy and Spain, there will be fewer than two workers for every retiree. Do the math. If two people have to pay for the full living expenses, health care and pension of a third person, plus their own expenses, plus the taxes to run the government, what happens? Taxes go up. Massive, crushing taxes. And when taxes go up on labor, what does Matteo do? Does he stay and pay 60% of his income to support a system that will be bankrupt by the time he retires? No, he moves. he goes to the [music] US or Australia or Switzerland. This creates a death spiral. Young people leave. The tax base shrinks. The government raises taxes on the few young people remaining to cover the gap. More young people leave. We're already seeing this. In 2024, there were fewer than 370,000 births in Italy. That is the lowest number since the country was unified in 1861. And the political reality makes it worse. Who votes in Europe? Old people. If a politician says, "We need to cut pensions to save the economy," they lose the election by a landslide. If a politician says, "We need to bring in millions of immigrants to fix the ratio." They trigger a cultural backlash and lose the election. So, they do nothing. They borrow money to pay the pensions, kicking the can down the road until the road ends. And folks, we are reaching the cliff. Interactive element. Hey, quick question for the comments. If you were Mateo, would you stay and pay the taxes or would you leave? Let me know below. We're only two points in and we've already de-industrialized Germany and depopulated Italy. But surely Europe has a plan for the future, right? Surely they are building the next Google, [music] the next Nvidia, the next AI giant to save them. Oh, you sweet summer child. Three. The innovation vacuum, the tech graveyard. Here is a quick pop quiz. Name a European smartphone. Nokia dead. Erikson dead. Okay. Name a European search engine. Exactly. Now, name a European social media network. If you said Masttodon, you're technically correct, but you're also a nerd and nobody invites you to parties. The harsh reality is that the modern economy is digital. And Europe, well, Europe is effectively a digital colony of the United States. Look at the magnificent seven. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla. The combined market capitalization of these seven American companies is larger than the entire stock markets of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy combined. Seven companies are worth more than the industrial output of the Renaissance. Why is it because Europeans aren't smart? Of course not. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland. Deep Mind, the AI lab, started in London. The talent is there. The problem is that Europe has decided to become the world's regulatory superpower. There is an old joke in global business. [music] The United States innovates, China replicates, Europe regulates. While Silicon Valley was pouring billions into artificial intelligence, the European Union was busy writing the AI Act, a massive, comprehensive set of laws to police AI before they even had a successful AI company to police. It's like writing a rule book for a Mars colony before you've even built a rocket. Let's look at a case study. Mistral AI. [music] Mistral is a French AI startup. They are brilliant. They are basically Europe's last hope to compete with Open AI. But instead of spending 100% of their time training models, they have to spend huge resources navigating the labyrinth of the EU's GDPR, the Digital Markets Act, [music] and the Digital Services Act. Imagine you are a founder. If you start a company in the US, you have immediate access to 330 million people who all speak English, use the same currency mostly, and operate under roughly the same business laws. If you start in Europe, you might launch in France. Great. But to expand to Germany, you need to translate everything, hire German lawyers to navigate German labor laws and deal with completely different tax authority. Then you repeat that for Italy, Spain, Poland. It is death by a thousand cuts. This fragmentation means European startups rarely get big enough to compete. They hit a glass ceiling. And when they finally do get big, they get [music] bought by Americans. Deep Mind bought by Google. Skype bought by Microsoft. Booking.com owned by an American holding company. Europe is becoming an incubator for American corporations. They grow the talent and then the US harvests it. And this brings us to the most depressing stat of the section. In 2008, Europe had 30% of the world's top 100 companies. Today, it has less than 14%. The future is being built in San Francisco and Shenzhen. Europe is just watching it happen on an iPhone designed in California and assembled in China. Four, the capital flight. Why money hates Europe? If you want to know the truth about an economy, don't listen to what politicians say. Watch where the money goes. Money has no patriotism. It only cares about returns. And right now, money is fleeing Europe like it's the Titanic. Let's talk about capital markets. It sounds boring, but stay with me. This is the reason why your American cousin is richer than you. Americans are obsessed with the stock market. 58% of American households own stock. In Germany, it's about 18%. Europeans keep their money in savings accounts, earning 0.5% interest, or they buy real estate. Because Europeans don't invest in stocks, European companies don't have a deep pool of money to draw from when they want to grow. Let's say you have a great idea for a biotech company in Berlin. You need $100 million to build a factory. In Europe, the banks will ask for collateral. The venture capitalists will offer you $5 million and ask for 40% of your company. So, what do you do? You go to New York. This happened with ARM Holdings. ARM is the most important company you've never heard of. They design the architecture for basically every smartphone chip on the planet. They are British, a jewel in the crown of UK tech. But when they decided to list on the stock market in [music] 2023, did they choose the London Stock Exchange? The pride of the empire? No. They listed on the NASDAQ in New York. Even European companies don't want to be European companies anymore. Spotify is Swedish, but it trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Bioentech, who made the FISA vaccine, is German, trades on the NASDAQ. Birkenstock, the Sandal Company, is German. trades on the NYC. This is a vicious cycle. European investors see low returns in Europe, so they invest in US funds. European companies see no money in Europe, so they move to the US. The US economy grows faster because it has all the capital. Repeat, the irony is palpable. Even the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, the largest pile of cash in Europe built on oil money, invests the vast majority of its equity portfolio in the United States. Europe is effectively funding its own decline by sending its savings to America to fuel American innovation, which then sells products back to Europe. It is financial cuckoldry on a continental scale. Listen, I know this is heavy. We've got dying factories, no babies, and all the money is moving to Miami. It's a lot. If you are enjoying this cheerful breakdown of economic collapse, do me a favor and destroy that like button. Unlike the European economy, it still works. [music] And I want to know if you had $100,000 to invest right now, would you put it in the S&P 500 USA or the DAX Germany? [music] Be honest. Put your answer in the comments. All right, wipe the tears away. We have two more massive problems to cover and the next one explains why your heating bill is higher than your rent. Five, the energy suicide, green dreams, cold reality. Energy is the master resource. It is the currency of physics. If energy is cheap, life is good. If energy is expensive, life is hard. Europe decided to play a game called let's see how hard we can make life. For the last 20 years, Europe has led the world in the green transition. And credit where credit is due, they have reduced emissions. But the way they did it was economically catastrophic. Here is the strategy Europe chose. Shut down reliable nuclear plants, especially in Germany and Belgium. Ban fracking for natural gas, unlike the US. Build massive amounts of wind and solar. Rely on cheap Russian gas as the backup for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. You see the flaw in the plan, right? Step four relied on a guy named Vladimir Putin being a nice, reliable partner. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the illusion shattered. Energy prices in Europe spiked to 10 times the average in the United States. While American factories were enjoying cheap domestic natural gas thanks to the shale revolution, European factories were paying ransom prices for LNG, liqufied natural gas, shipped in on tankers, often from the US. In 2023 and 2024, European industry paid roughly 3 to four times more for electricity than their competitors in the US and China. You cannot compete with that. [music] It doesn't matter how efficient your workers are. If your electricity bill is triple your competitors, you lose. And it's not just industry, [music] it's you. In the UK and Germany, energy poverty is a real term. People are choosing between heating and heating. The European grid is now a patchwork of instability. Because they invested so heavily in intermittent renewables, wind solar, without building enough storage, batteries, electricity prices can go negative 1 hour when it's windy and skyrocket the next when it stops. This volatility makes it impossible for businesses to plan. Europe bet the farm on a specific vision of the future. One where the world plays by rules, trade is free, and Russia is friendly. That world is gone. But the power plants are still shut down. And while Europe de-industrializes to save the planet, China is building two new coal plants every week. Europe is cutting its own throat to lower global emissions by a fraction of a percent while the rest of the world just keeps burning. Six, the geopolitical freeloader, the end of the peace dividend. Finally, we have to talk about defense, or rather the lack of it. For 75 years, Europe has lived in a magical garden protected by an American wall. After World War II, the deal was simple. The US provides security, NATO, and Europe focuses on rebuilding and social welfare. It was a great deal for Europe. They didn't have to spend money on aircraft carriers or fighter jets. Instead, they spent that money on free healthcare, 6 weeks of [music] paid vacation, and generous pensions. They spent their money on butter because America bought the guns. For decades, almost no NATO member met the 2% of GDP spending requirement. Germany's military became a joke. [music] At one point, reports surfaced that soldiers were using broomsticks during exercises because they didn't have enough rifles. But now, the peace dividend is over. War has returned to the continent. And suddenly, Europe realizes it has gutted its military-industrial base. Here is a terrifying fact. In a highintensity conflict, the British army would run out of ammo in 2 days. The German army isn't much better. Now, European governments are scrambling to rearm. But money spent on tanks is money not spent on hospitals. Money spent on artillery shells is money not spent on pensions. Europe is waking up to a harsh reality. Social democracy is expensive, [music] but safety is even more expensive. And for the first time in three generations, they have to pay for both. Can they afford it? With a stagnant economy, 0.1 a shrinking workforce point 2. and no tech growth.3. The math simply doesn't look good. In late 2024, the European Union panicked. They asked Mario Draghi, the man who saved the euro a decade ago, to write a report on the future of European competitiveness. His conclusion, it [music] was brutal. He basically said everything we just talked about. He warned that without radical change, Europe faces a slow agony. His words, not mine. Draghi called for massive investment, $800 billion per year to catch up to the US and China. That is two Marshall plans every [music] single year. But here is the tragedy. To get that money, Europe needs to unify. It needs to issue common debt. It needs to slash regulation. It needs to stop being 27 little countries in a trench coat and start acting like one superpower. And right now, the political will just isn't there. Germany doesn't want to pay for Italy's debt. [music] France wants to protect its farmers. Hungary is doing whatever Hungary is doing. So, we are left with two possible futures. Future A, the Renaissance. Europe wakes up. They cut the red tape. They embrace nuclear power. They incentivize families. They create a capital market that rivals Wall Street. It will be painful. It will require sacrifice, but it saves the continent. Future B, the museum. This is the path we're on now. Europe becomes a beautiful, stagnant retirement home for the world. The rich will visit to see the coliseum and the Eiffel Tower. They will stay in hotels owned by Americans, eat food imported from Africa, and be served by an underclass of immigrants, while the native population slowly fades away. It will be a comfortable decline. The lights won't go out all at once. [music] The trains will just run a little slower. The hospitals will get a little more crowded. the taxes will get a little higher until one day you look around and the party is over. There is a lesson here for everyone, regardless of where you live. Success is not permanent. Wealth is not guaranteed. Europe spent 500 years conquering the world, inventing the modern economy, and building the greatest civilization in history. And in just 30 years of complacency, they threw it away. If it can happen to them, it can happen to anyone. I don't want Europe to fail. I love Europe. The world needs a strong Europe, but the math doesn't care about our feelings. If you found this analysis depressing, [music] good. That means you were paying attention. If you want to understand how the US managed to pull ahead while Europe fell behind, you need to watch our upcoming video on the American economic cheat code. It explains the other side of this coin. Don't forget to subscribe if you want to survive the next recession. I'll see you in the next

5. The Slow DEATH of The Petrodollar (And What Comes Next)

Imagine you're walking into your local grocery store. You grab a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, maybe a carton of eggs. You get to the register, pull out a $20 bill, the same bill you've used your entire life, and the cashier looks at you like you just handed them a Monopoly ticket. They shake their head. Sorry, they say, "We don't take those anymore." It sounds like a dystopian nightmare, right? The kind of thing that only happens in collapsed states like Venezuela or Zimbabwe. But here's the terrifying truth. The only reason that piece of paper in your pocket has value, the only reason you can trade it for food, fuel, and shelter, is because of a secret handshake made in a dark room 50 years ago. For half a century, the United States has lived in an economic fairy tale, printing infinite money to buy real world goods because the rest of the planet was forced to use our currency to buy energy. But the engine that kept that dream alive is sputtering. The handshake is broken. And the timeline for the end of the American Empire isn't measured in decades anymore. It's measured in years. Today, we are going to peel back the layers of the greatest financial trick ever pulled. We're going to walk through the secret meetings, the assassinations, and the shadow wars that kept the dollar on the throne. And most importantly, we're going to look at exactly what happens to you when the king finally falls. Welcome to the slow, painful death of the petro dollar. one, the secret deal that saved America. [music] To understand how the world ends, we have to go back to how it began. And it didn't begin in a boardroom in New York or a congressional hearing in DC. It began on a humid morning in July 1974 in the coastal city of Jedha, Saudi Arabia. Let's set the scene because the vibe in America at this moment was absolutely wretched. The year is 1974. The glory days of the 1950s are dead and buried. The country is bleeding. President Richard Nixon is drowning in the Watergate scandal and about to resign in disgrace. But the real crisis isn't political. It's economic. 3 years earlier in 1971, Nixon had shocked the world by closing the gold window. Up until that point, every US dollar was basically a claim check for a specific amount of gold sitting in Fort Knox. But America had printed too many claim checks to pay for the Vietnam War and the Great Society welfare programs. Foreign nations led by the French started calling our bluff demanding their gold. Nixon didn't have it. So he defaulted. He told the world, "Sorry, your dollars are now just paper. The dollar crashed. Inflation tore through the American suburbs. And then just to kick us while we were down, the Arab nations launched the 1973 oil embargo. They turned off the taps to punish the West for supporting Israel in the Yamipur war. If you're too young to remember this, ask your parents or grandparents. It was chaos. Gas prices quadrupled overnight. People waited in lines for 6 hours just to fill up their tanks. Americans were shooting each other at gas stations. The stock market lost 45% of its value. The US economy looked like it was heading for a total collapse. The dollar was dying. Enter William Simon. You probably haven't heard of him, but William Simon is the man who arguably saved the American Empire. He was the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, but before that, he was a bond trader at Salomon Brothers. [music] And not just any trader, he was a shark. He was arrogant, chains smoking, and brilliant. He understood one thing better than anyone else. Debt. In July 1974, President Nixon sent Simon on a diplomatic tour of Europe and the Middle East. That was the cover story. The press was told it was a standard meet and greet, [music] but the real mission was secret. Simon took a small team and flew to Saudi Arabia for a 4-day layover in Jedha. His orders from the White House were blunt and terrifying. [music] Do not come back empty-handed. Failure would mean the Soviet Union wins the Cold War and the American economy implodes. Simon sat down with the Saudi royal family and made them an offer that sounds like something out of a mafia movie. The deal was simple but revolutionary. Part one, the United States would guarantee the survival of the House of Saud. We would sell them the most advanced military weapons on Earth. Fighter [music] jets, tanks, missiles. We would be their bodyguard in a very dangerous neighborhood. If anyone, Iran, Iraq, the Soviets, Israel, [music] looked at them the wrong way, Uncle Sam would step in. Part two. In exchange, Saudi Arabia had to do two things. First, they had to use their dominant position in OPEC to ensure that every single drop of oil sold anywhere in the world was priced in US dollars, not German marks, not Japanese yen, and certainly not gold, only dollars. This meant that if France wanted to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, they first had to buy US dollars to pay for it. If Japan wanted energy, they had to buy US dollars. This created a permanent artificial demand for the US dollar that would never go away. But wait, there was a catch. The Saudis were about to make trillions of dollars selling this oil. What were they going to do with all that cash? They couldn't just stuff it under the mattress in the palace. This leads to part three, the genius stroke of the deal, recycling. Simon convinced the Saudis to take those billions of petro dollars and immediately invest them back into the United States. Specifically, they would buy US Treasury bonds. [music] They would use their oil profits to fund America's national debt. Think about the elegance of this scam. We print paper dollars to buy their oil. They take those paper dollars and lend them back to us so we can buy more oil. It was a perpetual motion machine of wealth extraction. America got oil for free and the rest of the world paid for it by dealing with the inflation. But the Saudis had one major condition. They were paranoid. They knew that if the rest of the Arab world found out they were funding the US government, Israel's biggest ally, King Fel might wake up with a knife in his back. The deal had to be invisible. So, William Simon did something unprecedented. He rigged the US national debt auctions. Normally, when the US sells debt, it's a public auction. Everyone knows who bought what. But Simon created a special add-on system strictly for the Saudi central bank. It allowed them to buy billions in US debt secretly, bypassing the auction completely. No paper trail, no public records. For 40 years, this secret clause was hidden from the American public. It wasn't until 2016 after a Freedom of Information Act request by Bloomberg that the Treasury finally admitted the scale of the Saudi holdings. This handshake in Jedda was the birth of the petro dollar. It stabilized the US currency. It funded our military expansion and it allowed Americans to consume far more than we produced for five decades. It was the greatest economic moat ever built. But moes dry up and alliances crumble. As we're about to see, the Saudis didn't sign a suicide pact. They signed a business deal. And business conditions are changing. Business conditions are changing. Two, how the dollar actually conquered the world. Okay, so William Simon and the Saudis shook hands. the deal was done. But to truly understand why your grocery bill is skyrocketing today, you have to understand the mechanics of the machine they built. You have to understand how the dollar went from being America's money to the oxygen of the global economy. To explain this, I don't want you to think like an American. I want you to imagine you are the finance minister of a developing nation. Let's call it the Republic of hard work. It's 1985. Your country is industrializing. You have factories. You have ambitious people and you have resources. But you have one massive problem. You don't have oil. Without oil, your factories stop running. Your trucks stop moving. The lights go out and your people starve. You need to import it. So you call up Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or Nigeria. And you say, "I would like to buy 1 million barrels of oil, please." You offer to pay them in your local currency, the hardwork peso. The line goes dead. They laugh at you. Why? Because nobody wants your pesos. They can't spend them. They can't buy missiles with them. They can't buy real estate in London with them. They tell you, "Come back when you have US dollars." This is the trap. This is the mechanism that conquered the world. To keep your country alive, you now have to go out and find US dollars. But you can't print them. Only the US Federal Reserve can do that. So, how do you get them? You have to work for them. You have to force your citizens to wake up at 5 or a.m. go to a factory and sew t-shirts, assemble electronics, or grow bananas. You then put those real tangible goods, which cost sweat, blood, and natural resources to create, on a boat and send them to the United States. The United States receives your t-shirts and bananas. In exchange, they send you pieces of green paper with dead presidents on them, or more accurately, digital digits on a screen. Think about the [music] unfairness of that trade for a second. Your country gave up real wealth, labor, time, resources. The US gave up nothing. The cost to print a $100 bill is about 14. The US gets the TV, you get the paper, but you take that paper because you have no choice, and you send it to Saudi Arabia to get your oil. Now, follow the money. What does Saudi Arabia do with those dollars? As we discussed, per the secret deal, they don't hide them under a mattress. They turn around and invest them in US Treasury bonds. They lend that money back to the United States government, earning interest. This is the petro dollar recycling loop, and it is the economic equivalent of a cheat code in a video game. In the 1960s, the French finance minister Valerie Jiscar Dang famously called this America's exorbitant privilege. He was furious about it. He realized that while France, Germany, and Japan had to hustle and export real cars and wine to pay for their imports, the United States could simply write a check, if the check bounced, we'd just print more money to cover it. Because every nation needed oil, every nation needed to hoard dollars. This created an artificial, bottomless demand for US currency. It meant the United States could run massive deficits that would bankrupt any other nation. We could fund a welfare state and a warfare state simultaneously. We could have guns and butter. But there was a dark side to this privilege, a cost that most Americans didn't see until it was too late. Because the whole world was desperate to get dollars to buy oil, the value of the dollar stayed artificially high. A strong dollar sounds great, right? It means cheap vacations to Europe and cheap electronics at Walmart. But for American manufacturers, it was a death sentence. A strong dollar made American goods expensive for the rest of the world. It made it impossible for a factory in Ohio to compete with a factory in China or Vietnam. The petro dollar system effectively demanded that the US economy transition from making stuff to making debt. We hollowed out the rust belt. We closed the steel mills. We shuttered the textile plants. We exported our industrial base and replaced it with a financialized economy of banks, hedge funds, and service jobs. We traded our independence for cheap imports and the ability to borrow cheaply. And for decades, the world played along. Why? Because the system was stable. The US Navy patrolled the shipping lanes. And frankly, there was no alternative. If you tried to buck the system, you got crushed. The dollar was the only game in town. It was the cleanest dirty shirt in the laundry basket. Even America's enemies had to use the dollar. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sold oil in dollars. North Korea, Iran, Venezuela. When they sell on the global market, the benchmark pricing is in dollars. It's insidious. You cannot escape it. This system turned the US Treasury bond into the global risk-free asset. It's the piggy bank of the world. When China makes a profit, they buy treasuries. When Japan makes a profit, they buy treasuries. Central banks hold trillions of dollars in reserves just in case. But this system relies on one crucial psychological pillar. Trust. Trust that the US will pay its debts. Trust that the dollar will hold its value. And most importantly, trust that the US won't weaponize the currency system against the people holding it. For 40 years, that trust held. The system was neutral. It was like a public utility. The water company doesn't shut off your water just because they don't like your politics. The dollar was the plumbing of the world and the US was just the plumber. But then we started messing with the plumbing. We started deciding who could drink the water and who died of thirst. In the next section, we're going to look at what happens when a dictator decides he's tired of playing by these rules. We're going to look at a man who controlled 10% of the world's oil and who made the fatal mistake of asking the most dangerous question in history. Why can't I sell my oil in euros? His name was Saddam Hussein, and his decision may have been the real reason for a war that defined a generation. Three, Saddam's mistake and the Iraq war. Let's play a word association game. If I say Iraq war, what pops into [music] your head? Weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell holding a vial of anthrax at the UN. Mission accomplished. The axis of evil. Yellow cake uranium. For the last two decades, that is the narrative we have been fed. We were told that Saddam Hussein was a madman with his finger on a nuclear button, ready to strike the West. We were told he was harboring al-Qaeda. We were told we had to fight them over there so we didn't have to fight them here. But what if I told you that the most dangerous weapon Saddam Hussein possessed wasn't a chemical missile or a biological agent? What if I told you his most lethal weapon was a bank account denominated in the wrong currency? Welcome to the theory of petro dollar warfare. To understand this, we have to rewind the tape to November 2000. The Twin Towers are still standing. The dotcom bubble is [music] bursting. And in Baghdad, Saddam Hussein is frustrated. He's been under crushing UN sanctions for a decade. Under the UN's oil for food program, Iraq was allowed to sell oil, but the money went into a UN controlled escrow account in New York to ensure he spent it on humanitarian supplies, not weapons. But Saddam wanted to send [music] a message. He wanted to spit in the face of the American Empire. So on November 6th, 2000, Iraq made a stunning announcement. The Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organization told the United Nations that from this moment forward, they would no longer accept US dollars for their oil. They demanded payment in the euro. Now, you have to understand how laughable this sounded at the time. The euro was the new kid on the block. It had only been introduced as an accounting currency in 1999, and physically it wouldn't even be in people's pockets until 2002. It was weak. It was trading at around 82 cents to the dollar. Financial analysts in London and New York openly mocked Saddam. They said, "He's an idiot. He's letting his political hatred lose him millions in revenue." And initially, they were right. By forcing the UN to convert his oil sales into a depreciating currency, Iraq lost a fortune. The skepticism was so high that the UN actually allowed it, probably thinking, "Go ahead, bankrupt yourself." But then something strange happened. The wind shifted. Between 2001 and 2002, the euro began to rally. It climbed from 82 cents back up to par with the dollar and then kept climbing. Suddenly, the madman of the Middle East looked like a financial genius. By pricing his oil in euros, Iraq was actually making more profit than if he had stayed with the dollar. This caught the attention of some very powerful, very nervous people, not just in Washington, but in Caracus, Thran, and Moscow. Here is the nightmare scenario that began keeping Federal Reserve officials awake at night. Contagion. Iraq controlled the second largest proven oil reserves in the world at that time. If Saddam Hussein proved that you could sell oil in euros and actually make a better return, what was stopping the rest of OPEC from following suit? Imagine if Iran, which had been under US sanctions for years, decided to switch? Imagine if Venezuela, under Hugo Chavez, who was already a thorn in America's side, decided to switch. In April 2002, a man named Javad Yajani, the head of market analysis for OPEC, gave a speech in Ovido, Spain. It was a boring technical speech, the kind that usually puts people to sleep. But midway through he dropped a bombshell. He suggested that maybe in the long term it might make sense for OPEC to shift some of its reserves into euros. He hinted that the dollar's monopoly wasn't set in stone. This was the smoke alarm going off. If OPEC shifted to the euro, the demand for US dollars would collapse. Nations around the world would dump their US Treasury bonds to buy euro bonds. The recycling loop we talked about in the last section, the engine of American prosperity would seize up. The US dollar would crash. Inflation would skyrocket. And the ability of the US government to fund its massive budget deficits would vanish. The petro dollar wasn't just a currency arrangement. It was the structural beam holding up the American superpower. And Saddam was taking a sledgehammer to it. Now look at the timeline. It is almost too perfect. November 2000, Iraq switches to the euro. 2001, 2002, the euro rises, Iraq profits. OPEC starts whispering about a shift. August 2002, the Bush administration suddenly ramps up the rhetoric about regime change in Iraq. The focus shifts from hunting bin Laden in the caves of Afghanistan to hunting Saddam in the palaces of Baghdad. [music] We were told it was about WMDs. We were shown satellite photos of aluminum tubes. [music] We were told about yellow cake uranium from Niger, but let's look at the smoking gun that nobody talks about. On March 19th, 2003, the US military launched Operation Iraqi Freedom. Shock and awe lit up the Baghdad sky. Within weeks, the Statue of Saddam was toppled. The regime was decapitated. And what was the very first economic decision made by the American occupiers? Before the dust had even settled, before a new government was formed, the coalition provisional authority, the US-run government in Iraq, issued a directive. The sale of Iraqi oil was immediately switched back to US dollars. The euro account was closed. The billions of euros that Iraq had accumulated were converted back into greenbacks. The threat was neutralized. The message to the rest of OPEC was loud, clear, and bloody. If you try to leave the dollar, we will come for you. Critics will say this is a conspiracy theory. They'll say, "Oh, come on. You don't invade a country over currency exchange rates." And fair enough, history is complex. There were neoonservatives who wanted to spread democracy. [music] There were defense contractors who wanted contracts. There were geopolitical strategists worried about Israel. It's rarely just one thing, but in the world of geopolitics, you have to follow the money. Consider the oil law that was pushed by the US administration in 2007. The draft law, which was heavily influenced by Western oil executives, didn't just cement the dollar usage. It proposed production sharing agreements, PSAs, [music] that would have given foreign oil companies, Exon Mobile, Chevron, BP, massive control over Iraq's reserves for up to 30 years. Before the war, Iraq's oil was fully nationalized. The profits belong to the state. The US tried to privatize it. While the full privatization didn't pass due to massive Iraqi resistance, the Western oil majors eventually got back in via service contracts. But the most important victory for Washington was secured on day one. Are was back in the petro dollar orbit. This war bought the dollar another decade of dominance. It scared the living daylights out of anyone else thinking about switching. Iran, who had been flirting with the idea of an oil priced in euros, suddenly got very quiet about it. Hugo Chavez in Venezuela kept shouting, but he was careful not to push too hard. The world saw Saddam hanging from a rope, and they understood the price of financial rebellion. But you can't bomb an idea out of existence. You can execute a dictator, but you can't execute simple math. The math remained, the US was printing too much money. The debt was growing, and the rest of the world was getting tired of subsidizing the American lifestyle. While the US was busy bogged down in the insurgency in Fallujah and Ramadi, spending trillions on a war to protect the dollar, another threat was rising in Africa. A threat that wasn't about selling oil in euros, but about something far more dangerous, gold. In the next section, we travel to Libya. We're going to meet Colonel Mama Gaddafi. He wasn't just an eccentric dictator with funny sunglasses and female bodyguards. He was the architect of a plan that would have united the entire African continent and severed the financial chains of the west once and for all. He called it the gold dinar. And just like Saddam, his curiosity about alternative currencies would cost him everything. Four. Gaddafi's gold dinar and the African dream. If Saddam Hussein was the man who tried to change the currency of of oil, Mama Gaddafi was the man who tried to change the currency of an entire continent. And if you think the war in Iraq was about oil, wait until you hear why NATO really turned the skies over Libya into a shooting gallery in 2011. Let's transport you to 2009. You're standing in a grand conference hall in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The room is filled with African heads of state. At the podium stands Gaddafi. He is the king of kings, the chairman of the African Union. [music] He is charismatic, eccentric, and absolutely flush with cash. Libya is not a poor country. [music] In fact, under Gaddafi, it has the highest standard of living in Africa. Free electricity, free healthcare. Newlyweds receive $50,000 from the government to buy their first apartment. Gas is 14 cents a liter. But Gaddafi isn't satisfied with just making Libya rich. He has a bigger dream. A dream that has terrified European colonizers for a century. The United States of Africa. Gaddafi is tired of seeing Africa rich in resources but poor in money. He looks at the map and sees a continent that produces gold, diamonds, oil, cobalt, and uranium, yet sets the prices for none of them. He sees African nations trading with each other using the currencies of their former masters, the British pound, the US dollar, and especially the French CFA Frank. [music] So he proposes a radical solution. He calls it the gold dinar. The plan was ambitious but simple. Libya would lead the creation of a new pan-African currency. But unlike the dollar or the euro, which are fiat currencies backed by nothing but government promises, the gold dena would be backed by actual physical gold, Gaddafi had the muscle to pull this off. Libya's central bank was sitting on a massive horde estimated at 143 tons of gold and a similar amount in silver. At the time, [music] this stash was worth over $7 billion. his vision. He told African nations, "Let's stop selling our oil and minerals for paper money that the west prints out of thin air. Let's demand they pay us in gold dinars. If they want our resources, they have to buy our currency." This would have shifted the economic center of gravity from Paris and New York to Tripoli. It would have empowered a continent that had been exploited for 400 years. But there was one country that looked at this plan and saw an existential threat. And it wasn't the United States. It was France. To understand why, you have to know about the CFA Frank. This is one of the biggest scams in modern finance. 14 African countries, mostly former French colonies, use the CFA Frank. It is a currency that is printed in France and controlled by the French central bank. For decades, France required these African nations to deposit 50% of their foreign currency reserves into the French Treasury. Essentially, France was holding their wallets. This system allows France to [music] maintain massive influence over its former colonies, effectively getting free loans and cheap resources. It is the lifeblood of French soft power in Africa. Gaddafi's gold dinar was designed to kill the CFA Frank. If African nations switched to a goldbacked currency, the CFA system would collapse. France's influence in West Africa would evaporate overnight. Now, fast forward to February 2011. The Arab Spring is sweeping across the Middle East. Protests erupt in Benghazi against Gaddafi's 40-year rule. The Western media narrative is immediate and uniform. Gaddafi is a brutal dictator killing his own people. We must intervene to save the civilians. And look, let's be real. Gaddafi was a dictator. He was ruthless. He tortured dissident. He wasn't a choir boy. But the world is full of ruthless dictators that the West happily does business with. Why was this specific dictator at this specific moment priority number one? We don't have to guess. We have the receipts. On April 1st, 2011, a man named Sydney Blumenthal, a longtime adviser and confidant to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sent an email to her private server. This email was later declassified and released to the public. You can go read it right now on the State Department's virtual reading room. The subject line was France's client and Gaddafi's gold. In this intelligence memo, Blumenthal explains exactly why French President Nicholas Sarazi was leading the charge for a military attack on Libya. He lists five reasons. The first four are standard politics, obtaining Libyan oil, increasing French influence, etc. But the fifth reason is the smoking gun. Blumenthal wrote that the French intelligence service had discovered Gaddafi's plan to use his massive gold and silver reserves to create a pan-African currency. The memo explicitly states, "This gold was accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden dinar. This plan was designed to provide the franophhone African countries with an alternative to the French Frank CFA." The email continues stating that French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the rebellion began and it was one of the factors that influenced President Sarazi's decision to commit the French military to the attack. There it is in black and white. The West didn't invade Libya just to protect civilians in Benghazi. They invaded because Gaddafi had 143 tons of gold and a plan to break the French banking system. And the response was swift. In March 2011, a NATO coalition led by France, the UK, and the US began bombing Libya. They destroyed the Libyan Air Force. They destroyed the command centers. They armed the rebels. By October 2011, Gaddafi was dead. He was found hiding in a drainage pipe in Certi, dragged out by rebels, beaten and executed on camera. And what happened to the gold? That is the billion dollar question. The 143 tons of gold vanished. Some say it was stolen by the rebels. Some say it was trucked across the desert into Ner. Some say it's sitting in vaults in London or Paris now. But one thing is certain. The goldena died with Gaddafi. The dream of a unified African currency was buried in the rubble of Tripoli. Today, Libya is a failed state. It is a fractured ruin ruled by competing warlords. [music] There are openair slave markets where human beings are sold for a few hundred. The oil still flows, of course, but the profits don't go to building apartments for newlyweds anymore. The message to the global south was reinforced, written in blood, just like in Iraq. Do not challenge the financial hegemony. But here is the irony. While the West was busy playing whack-a-ole with dictators in the Middle East and Africa, they took their eye off the real threat. They were so focused on crushing the small rebellions that they didn't notice the giant waking up in the east. [music] They didn't notice that Russia and China were watching these wars and taking notes. Vladimir Putin saw what happened to Saddam. He saw what happened to Gaddafi. He realized that as long as Russia was part of the Western financial system, they were vulnerable. If the US could turn off Iraq's money, they could turn off Russia's money. So, while NATO was celebrating the fall of Tripoli, Moscow began to quietly build a fortress. They started dumping their US dollars. They started buying gold, lots of it, and they started coding a new digital language that would allow banks to talk to each other without America listening. In the next section, we're going to look at the moment the US finally pulled the trigger on the financial nuke, kicking a major superpower out of the banking system and how that decision backfired spectacularly, accelerating the very thing it was meant to prevent. Five, weaponized finance and the Russian pivot. If the Iraq war was a warning shot and Libya was an execution, what happened in February 2022 was a suicide bombing. Not a physical one, but a financial one. It was the moment the West decided to detonate the foundation of its own economic power in a desperate attempt to stop a tank division. Let's take you back to February 24th, 2022. Vladimir Putin announces the special military operation. Russian tanks roll across the border into Ukraine. The world watches in horror. The response from the West was immediate. But while sending javelins and stingers took time, the financial response was instantaneous. The US, the UK, and the European Union decided to unleash the financial nuclear option. They were going to do something that had never been done to a G20 economy before. They didn't just sanction a few oligarchs or ban some vodka imports. [music] They went for the jugular. First, they kicked major Russian banks out of Swift. Now, you hear this acronym a lot, but let's clarify what SWIFT actually is. It stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Think of it as the WhatsApp group chat for global banks. It's a messaging system that allows a bank in New York to tell a bank in Moscow, "Hey, I'm sending you $10 million." If you get kicked out of Swift, you're financially blind and mute. You can't send money. You can't receive money. You're exiled from the global village. For decades, this was the ultimate threat. It was the weapon the US held to the head of every nation, saying, "Behave or we will unplug you." But then the West did something even more extreme. Something that made central bankers in Beijing, Riyad, and Brazilia choke on their coffee. They froze the reserves of the Central Bank of Russia. Russia had spent years building up a fortress balance sheet. They had $630 billion in foreign reserves, money they had earned by selling oil and gas. They thought this money was safe. They thought that sovereign property rights was sacred. Over a single weekend, the US and its allies froze roughly $300 billion of that money. Just like that, poof, gone. The narrative in the West was triumphant. We have crushed the ruble. We have destroyed their war chest. The Russian economy will collapse in weeks. And initially the ruble did crash. It fell to 140 to the dollar. President Biden [music] stood up and bragged that the ruble was now rubble. But then the smoke cleared and the West realized they had made a catastrophic miscalculation. By weaponizing the dollar so aggressively they broke the cardinal rule of banking, neutrality. Think about it. If you deposit money in a bank, you expect to be able to withdraw it even if the bank manager hates you. If the bank manager can seize your life savings just because he disagrees with your politics, you will find a new bank. The message sent to the world was chilling. Your dollars are not your money. They are permission slips from the US government. And those permissions can be revoked at any time. This was the wakeup call for the global south. China looked at this and thought, "We have $3 trillion in reserves. If we invade Taiwan, they will take it all." Saudi Arabia thought, "If we disagree with American foreign policy, our money is gone." So instead of collapsing, Russia pivoted. [music] And this pivot is what killed the fear of US sanctions forever. Putin did the unthinkable. On March 23rd, 2022, he announced that unfriendly countries, meaning Europe, would have to pay for Russian gas in rubles. This was a direct violation of the petro dollar order. Europe was outraged. They said, "That's a breach of contract." Putin effectively said, "You stole our dollars, so dollars are worthless to us. Use rubles or freeze." And guess what? [music] Europe folded. They needed the gas. They set up complex accounts at Gazprom Bank to convert euros to rubles. The ruble didn't just recover. It became the best performing currency in the world against the dollar later that year. But the bigger story is what happened behind the scenes. Russia began building a parallel financial system, a shadow economy that the US couldn't touch. Since they were kicked out of Swift, they ramped up their own system called SPFS. It's clunky. It's smaller, but it works. More importantly, they connected it to China's [music] system, CIP, crossber interbank payment system. Suddenly, Russian oil started flowing to India and China in record volumes. But it wasn't being sold in dollars. It was being sold in rupes, yuan and dirhams. A shadow fleet of oil tankers emerged. Hundreds of aging ships with obscure ownership sailing without western insurance carrying Russian oil to the world. The US tried to impose a price cap on Russian oil, saying, "You can't sell it for more than $60 a barrel." The market laughed. Russia sold it for whatever the market would pay, and the global south happily bought it. Why? Because India doesn't care about the war in Donbus. India cares about cheap energy for its 1.4 billion people. This was the turning point. The sanctions failed to stop the war, but they succeeded in destroying the myth of the dollar's indispensability. Before 2022, the idea of trading oil without dollars was a fringe theory. After 2022, it became a survival strategy. The volume of trade between Russia and China exploded, hitting over $240 billion in 2023, [music] with almost none of it settled in dollars. The US had played its ace card. They fired the financial nuke and Russia survived. This revealed a terrifying truth to Washington. The world needs commodities more than it needs dollars. You can print dollars, but you can't print oil. You can't print wheat. You can't print nickel or palladium. Russia has the stuff. America has the paper. In a war of attrition, the stuff wins. Now the floodgates are open. The fear is gone. Other nations are looking at Russia and saying, "Yeah, hey, the water is fine outside the dollar system." And leading this charge is the dragon in the room. The country with the industrial might to actually rival the US. In the next section, we're going to look at the petroan. China isn't just buying oil in its own currency. It's building a mechanism to turn that currency directly into gold, creating a loophole that allows oil producers to exit the dollar forever without taking any risk. This is the mechanism that keeps the Saudi king up at night in a good way. Six. The rise of the petro. There is an old rule in business. The customer is always right. But there is a more important rule in geopolitics. The biggest customer makes the rules. For decades, the United States was the world's biggest importer of oil. We were the thirsty giant. That meant we got to decide how the oil was sold. But thanks to the shale revolution, America is now energy independent. We don't need Saudi oil the way we used to. But you know who does? China. China is now the largest importer of crude oil on the planet. Every single day, a fleet of super tankers arrives in Chinese ports to feed its massive industrial machine. And for years, China had to do something that made its leaders absolutely sick to their stomachs. They had to pay for that oil in US dollars. Think about the absurdity of this from Beijing's perspective. China is America's biggest rival. Yet, to keep their lights on, they have to use their rivals currency. This means China has to constantly earn dollars, hold dollars, and use the dollar banking system. Every time China buys a barrel of oil from Angola or Russia, the transaction clears through a US bank, giving Washington a map of China's energy flows and the power to freeze them. Xiinping decided this was a strategic chokeold he could no longer tolerate. He wanted to buy oil in UN. But there was a problem, a big one. Oil producers like the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Iranians didn't want [music] UN. Why? Because the Yuan is a trapped currency. It's strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. You can't just freely take it out of China. If you sell a billion dollars worth of oil to China and get paid in UN, what can you do with it? You can buy cheap plastic toys or build a factory in Shenzhen, but you can't easily go buy real estate in London or stocks in New York. The oil shakes looked at the UN and said, "No thanks. We prefer the dollar. We trust the dollar." So, in March 2018, China launched a financial product that changed the game. They opened the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, INE. They started offering the world's first UN denominated crude oil futures contract. And to solve the trust issue, they added a feature that is arguably the most brilliant financial trap ever set. They linked the oil contract to gold. Here is how the golden loophole works. You're an oil producer. You sell oil to China. China pays you in yan. You're worried the yuan might devalue or get stuck in China. So you immediately take that UN and use it to buy physical gold on the Shanghai gold exchange. You then load that gold onto a plane and fly it back to your vault in the Middle East. Do you see what just happened? China effectively recreated a gold standard for trade. They created a mechanism where oil is traded for gold with the UN just acting as a temporary middleman for a few seconds. The producers love this. Gold is the ultimate safe asset. [music] It has no counterparty risk. It can't be frozen by the US Treasury. It can't be printed into oblivion by the Federal Reserve. This system bypasses the US dollar, the US banking system and swift entirely. It is a completely dark independent loop. Western analysts laughed at this in 2018. They said the volume would be tiny. They said the Brent and WTI benchmarks are too strong. Nobody will switch. They were wrong. The volume on the Shanghai exchange has exploded. It is now the third largest oil market in the world. >> [music] >> And in a crisis like say a war over Taiwan, this market ensures that China can keep buying energy even if the US completely exiles them from the dollar system. But the Petroan isn't just about survival for China. It's about seduction. China is actively courting the Saudis, telling them the Americans are lecturing you about human rights. They are blocking your weapon sales. They're devaluing the money you hold. We, on the other hand, just want to do business. we will pay you in gold and the Saudis [music] are listening. In the next section, we're going to look at the moment the marriage finally broke. We'll examine the recent stunning shift in Saudi foreign policy that signals the official end of the 1974 deal and the beginning of a new era in the desert. Seven. Saudi Arabia betrays the 1974 pact. Relationships end. Sometimes it's a slow drift. Sometimes it's a screaming match. And sometimes one partner realizes they've been taken for granted for 50 years and decides to start dating the guy you hate. We are witnessing the divorce of the century between Washington and Riyad. And unlike a celebrity breakup, this one is going to cost you money. To understand why the 1974 Petradoll deal is dying, you have to look at the man currently running the show in Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman or MBS. MBS is not his grandfather. He isn't interested in bowing to American presidents or being the quiet gas station attendant for the West. He is young, ambitious, and ruthless. He has a vision called vision 2030 to transform his country into a global superpower, not just an oil well. And frankly, he hates how he's been treated. When Joe Biden ran for president in [music] 2020, he didn't just criticize Saudi Arabia. He promised to make them a pariah. He stopped selling them offensive weapons to fight the Houthis in Yemen. He released intelligence reports pinning the murder of journalist Jamal Kashogi directly on NBS. He effectively ghosted the crown prince. The Saudis took note. They realized the American security guarantee that part one of the 1974 deal was worthless. When Iranian drones attacked Saudi oil facilities in 2019, America didn't strike back. When the Houthies fired missiles at Jeda, America shrugged. So MBS decided to go shopping for a new best friend. Enter Siginping. In December 2022, the Chinese president visited Riyad. The welcome was fit for an emperor. While Biden got a fist bump in a quiet hallway, she got a royal procession, fighter jet flyovers, and a 3-day summit with Arab leaders. During that summit, Xiinping said the quiet part out loud. In a televised speech, he called for China and the Gulf nations to start settling oil and gas trades in Yuan. A few weeks later, in January 2023 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Saudi finance minister Muhammad Aljadan dropped the bomb. He told reporters, "There are no issues with discussing how we settle our trade arrangements, whether it is in the US dollar, whether it is the euro, whether it is the Saudi realal. Read that again. For 49 years, the answer was dollars only. Now, the answer is we're open to suggestions. This is the sound of the monopoly breaking. There was a lot of noise on the internet in June 2024 about the official expiry [music] of the 1974 petrodolla agreement. Viral posts claimed a secret 50-year contract had lapsed on June 9th. Now, fact checkers will tell you there was no single paper contract with a fixed expiration date. And technically, they are right. But they are missing the forest for the trees. Whether a paper contract expired is irrelevant. The alliance has expired. The exclusive marriage is over. Saudi Arabia has officially adopted a policy of Saudi first. They are joining the BRICS alliance, which we will get to in a minute. They're engaging with the Petrol UN. They are selling oil to France and euros. Why does this matter to you? Because Saudi Arabia is the central banker of oil. They are the swing producer. If they start accepting other currencies, the rest of OPEC will follow. The UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, they watch Riyad. If the world doesn't need dollars to buy Saudi oil anymore, they don't need to hold trillions in US Treasury bonds. And if they stop buying our debt, who buys it? The Federal Reserve, which means more money printing, which means the inflation you're feeling at the grocery store isn't a temporary glitch. It's the new baseline. The Saudis have realized that in a multipolar world, you don't pick a side. You play both sides. You sell oil to China in yuan, buy weapons from America in dollars, and stash gold in Switzerland. The petro dollar isn't dead yet. It's still the dominant currency, but it has been demoted. It is no longer the only option. It is now just one option among many. And in the world of finance, once you lose your monopoly, you lose your power. But the Saudis are just one piece of the puzzle. They are the supplier. The real revolution is happening among the consumers, [music] the billions of people in the global south who are tired of being pushed around by the G7. In the next section, we're going to look at the club that everyone wants to join. It started as an acronym for investment bankers, but it has morphed into an economic NATO that controls the majority of the world's population and resources. It's called BRICS, and they are building a wrecking ball aimed straight at the US Treasury. Eight. Bricks and the Global South Rebellion. For the last 70 years, the global economy has been like a high school cafeteria. The cool kids sat at the G7 table. America, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. They decided who got to sit with them. They decided what was on the menu, and they decided who got bullied. But something funny happened while the cool kids were busy patting themselves on the back. The nerds, the outcasts, and the quiet kids started their own table. And then they started buying up the cafeteria. Welcome to the bricks revolution. Originally, this was just a catchy acronym invented by a Goldman Sachs economist in 2001 to group the emerging markets. Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. For years, the West dismissed them as a talk shop, a random collection of countries that had nothing in common. What does a communist state like China have in common with a democracy like Brazil? They laughed. They aren't laughing anymore. In August 2023 at a summit in Johannesburg and later solidified in 2024, bricks officially expanded. They didn't just add random countries. They added strategic heavyweights. They invited Iran, the UAE, Egypt, and Ethiopia. Look at that list closely. What do you see? You see the world's gas station. By adding Iran and the UAE to a group that already includes Russia, BRICS now controls a massive chunk of the global energy supply. >> [music] >> You see the Suez Canal, Egypt. You see the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia. This isn't a social club. This is an economic NATO. And here is the statistic that should terrify Western policy makers. In terms of purchasing power par, PPP, which is a fancy way of measuring what money can actually buy in the real world, the BRICS nations have now officially surpassed the G7. That's right. The developing world now generates more real economic output than the developed world. The G7 creates value through financial derivatives, insurance products, and consulting fees. The BRICS nations create value through stuff. They grow the food. They mine the copper. They drill the oil. They manufacture the steel. If the G7 stops working, the world loses some hedge funds and marketing agencies. If brick stops working, the world freezes and starves. And what is the one thing binding this MLY crew together? It's not religion. It's not politics. It is a shared hatred of the US dollar's weaponization. President Lula of Brazil stood up at the summit and asked the room a simple question. Why? Why must every country tie its trade to the dollar? Who decided that the dollar would be the currency after the gold standard disappeared? The applause was deafening. This alliance is building the infrastructure for a post American world. They have created the new development bank NDB, a direct competitor to the IMF and World Bank. The IMF imposes austerity and demands political reforms in exchange for loans. The NDB says, "Here's the money for your dam or railway. We don't care about your politics. For a dictator in Africa or a struggling democracy in Asia, which loan are you going to take?" The global south, which represents about 85% of the human population, is tired of being lectured by the West. They are tired of rules-based order where the rules only apply to them. They see the US seizing Russian assets and think we're next. So, they are building a walled garden, a system where they can trade with each other without touching a single US bank. And this leads us to the technology that is going to make this separation possible. Because you can have all the political will in the world, but you need a mechanism to move the money. You need a new plumbing system. In the next section, we're going to look at the financial guillotine. It's a new type of currency that is programmable, instant, and completely bypasses the traditional banking system. It's called a CBDC, and it is the final nail in the coffin for the dollar's global dominance. Nine. The CBDC revolution and dollar destruction. There is a four-letter acronym that sounds boring, technocratic, and harmless, but it actually represents the single biggest technological threat to American power since the Soviet nuclear program. That acronym is CBDC, central bank digital currency. Now, before your eyes glaze over, let me clarify something important. This is not Bitcoin. This is not some libertian fantasy about freedom from the state. In fact, it is the exact opposite. >> [music] >> It is the ultimate tool of state control. But more importantly for our story, it is the weapon that will render youth sanctions obsolete. To understand why CBDC's are the dollar killer, we first have to look at how money moves today. It is archaic. If you're a business in China and you want to pay a supplier in Brazil, you can't just send the money. You have to use the correspondent banking system. Here is the journey your money takes. Your Chinese bank sends a message to its partner bank in New York, likely JP Morgan or City Bank. That New York bank moves US dollars from the Chinese bank's account to the Brazilian bank's account. The New York bank takes a fee. The Swift messaging system records the transaction. The money finally arrives in Brazil 2 to 4 days later. Notice the choke point. New York. Almost every major international crossber payment touches a US bank at some point. This gives the United States two things. The toll booth. We make money on everyone else's trade. The panopticon. We see everything. The US Treasury knows exactly who is buying what. If they see a transaction they don't like, say a payment for Iranian drone parts, they can tell that New York bank to freeze the funds. This is how sanctions work. It's plumbing and we own the pipes. But what if you could build a new set of pipes that didn't go through New York? Enter Project Mbridge. This isn't a [music] conspiracy theory. It is a real live pilot program being run by the Bank for International Settlements, BIS, the Central Bank of Central Banks. It involves China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the UAE. Project Embridge uses blockchain technology, the same tech behind crypto, but it adapts it for governments. It creates a shared ledger between these nations. Here is the new reality under Embridge. The Chinese business wants to pay the Brazilian supplier. They open their digital yuan wallet. They send the payment. The Embbridge platform instantly converts the EU into e-reals or simply swaps the tokenized value. The money arrives in the Brazilian wallet in seconds. Cost almost zero, time almost zero, US involvement zero. The transaction happens peer-to-peer between the central banks. There is no correspondent bank in New York. There is no swift message. The US government doesn't even know the trade happened until the ship arrives at the port. This is the financial stealth bomber. China is leading the world in this technology. They have already rolled out the ECNY digital yuan to millions of citizens. They're testing it for crossber trades right now. Think about the implications for the petro dollar. If Saudi Arabia and China fully integrate their CBDC systems, they can trade billions of dollars worth of oil instantly. The Saudis get paid in digital UN which they can immediately use to pay a Chinese construction firm to build a skyscraper in Riyad. The loop is closed. The dollar isn't just not needed. It is technologically inferior. Why would you use a fax machine swift when you have email CBDC? Why would you pay fees to an American bank and risk getting your assets frozen when you can settle instantly for free? The US is lagging woefully behind in this race. While China has a fully functional digital currency, the US Federal Reserve is still writing white papers and debating whether a digital dollar is a good idea. We are debating privacy concerns which are valid while the rest of the world is building the highway of the future. And it's not just China. Russia is developing the digital ruble. India has the digital [music] rupee. Brazil has the drex. Even the European Union is working on a digital euro. They are building a multi-rail payment world. This destroys the network effect of the dollar. For decades, you had to use dollars because everyone else used dollars. It was the only network that reached everywhere. But CBDC's are interoperable. They can talk to each other without a common language, the dollar. This technology also allows for something called atomic settlement. [music] In the old world, there was always counterparty risk, the fear that you send the goods, but the check bounces. With programmable CBDC's, you can use smart contracts. You code the money so that the payment is released automatically the exact second the oil tanker digitally signs into the port. No trust required, no lawyers required, no US dollars required. The scary part for Washington is the loss of vision. If the global drug trade, the global weapons trade, and the global energy trade move to these encrypted direct rails, the US intelligence community goes blind. We lose our ability to track terror financing. We lose our ability to enforce embargos. We become a bystander in the global economy, a large island nation shouting at passing ships that no longer stop at our ports. But while the rest of the world is building high-tech bypass roads around the dollar, the United States is busy doing something else that is equally destructive to its currency. We aren't just losing our technological edge. We're actively destroying the value of the dollar from the inside out. We are spending money like a drunken sailor who just stole a credit card. In the next section, we have to look at the domestic monster, the math that doesn't add up. We need to talk about the number $35,000,000,000,000. Because the biggest threat to the dollar isn't in Beijing or Moscow. It's in Washington DC. 10. The $35 trillion debt trap. We have spent the last 20 minutes talking about external threats. We've talked about Russian sanctions, Chinese gold, and Saudi princes. But the truth is, if the American Empire falls, it won't be because of a foreign army marching on Washington. It will be because of simple, cold, unforgiving math. The most dangerous enemy the United States faces today is not in Beijing or Moscow. It is in the mirror. Let's talk about the number that should terrify every single person holding a US dollar. $35,000,000,000,000. That is $35 trillion. It is a number so large the human brain literally cannot comprehend it. If you counted to a million, it would take you about 11 days. If you counted to a trillion, it would take you 31,000 years. We owe 35 of those. For decades, politicians and economists told you this number didn't matter. They subscribed to a theory effectively called modern monetary theory, MMT, or as I like to call it, magic money tree. The idea was simple. Since the US government can print its own currency, it can never go bankrupt. It can just print money to pay its bills. Deficits are a myth. Debt is just a number on a screen. And for a long time, they appeared to be right. From 2008 to 2021, interest rates were at zero. Inflation was low. The Federal Reserve could print trillions to bail out banks, fund wars, and send out stimulus checks. And the sky didn't fall. But that era of free money relied on one specific condition. The world had to want our debt. Remember the petro dollar recycling loop? The Saudis, the Chinese, the Japanese, they all took their excess dollars and bought US Treasury bonds. They subsidized our spending. They kept our borrowing cost artificially low. But now look at the trap we have walked into. In 2022, inflation returned with a vengeance. To fight it, the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates. They took rates from 0% to over 5% in record time. Here is where the math gets lethal. When you have $35 trillion in debt and you raise interest rates by 5%, your interest payments explode. In 2024, the United States government hit a terrifying milestone. For the first time in history, we spent more on interest payments on the national debt than we spent on the entire national defense budget. Read that again. We are spending more just to service the credit card bill of the past than we are on the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Space Force combined. We are spending more on interest than on Medicare. Soon interest will be the single largest line item in the federal budget, surpassing social security. This is what economists call a debt spiral or fiscal dominance. It works like this. One, the government runs a deficit, spends more than it makes. Two, it issues debt to cover the gap. Three, it has to pay interest on that debt. Four, the interest expense is so high that it creates an even bigger deficit. Five. So, the government has to borrow more money just to pay the interest on the old money. It is a Ponzi scheme. The only way it keeps going is if you can find new suckers to buy the debt. But remember the earlier sections of this video. The suckers are walking away. China is selling treasuries. Saudi Arabia is buying gold. Russia is gone. Japan is struggling to defend its own currency and can't buy as much as it used to. So, who is buying the debt? The data is clear. The biggest buyers are now domestic hedge funds, money market funds, and the Federal Reserve itself. We are cannibalizing our own economy. We are printing money to buy our own debt. This brings us to the concept of exporting inflation. For 50 years, this was America's superpower. When we printed a trillion dollars, those dollars didn't stay in Ohio or Florida. They flowed overseas. They went to China to buy TVs, to Saudi Arabia to buy oil, [music] to Brazil to buy coffee. The world acted as a sponge for our inflation. We got the cheap goods, they got the inflation. But as ddollarization accelerates, as the petro dollar dies, that sponge is drying up. If the Saudis sell oil in UN, they don't need dollars. If China trades with Russia in rubles, they don't need dollars. So, what happens when the Federal Reserve prints a trillion dollars to fund the next war or the next bailout? But the world says, "No thanks. We're full." Those dollars have nowhere to go. They're trapped inside the borders of the United States. [music] They chase domestic goods. They chase domestic real estate. They chase domestic stocks. This is why your rent is up 30%. This is why a dozen eggs cost $6. This is why a used Honda Civic costs as much as a new one used to. The inflation is coming home to roost. The US government is now caught in a trap with no exit. Option A, default. Tell the world, "Sorry, we aren't paying you back." This would cause a global financial collapse that makes the Great Depression look like a picnic. It's political suicide. Option B, austerity. Cut spending, slash social security, cut the military in half, fire government workers, raise taxes by 50%. also political suicide. No politician will ever run on this platform. Option C, inflate it [music] away. This is the path of least resistance. The Federal Reserve will print the money to pay the debt. They will monetize the deficit. They will sacrifice the value of the dollar to save the bond market. History tells us that governments always choose option C. [music] From Rome to VHimar, Germany to Zimbabwe. When the debt gets unpayable, they print. They will steal your wealth not by taking it from your bank account [music] but by making every dollar in your bank account worth less. It is a hidden tax and this leads to the most terrifying scenario of all. The Triffin dilemma in reverse. For years we flooded the world with dollars. There are trillions of paper dollars euro dollars floating around outside the US in foreign bank accounts in mattresses in Argentina in vaults in Lebanon. What happens if the world loses faith? What happens if the foreigners decide not just to stop buying our debt, but to sell the dollars they already have? Imagine a tsunami, but instead of water, it's green paper. In the next section, we're going to simulate exactly what happens when those trillions of overseas dollars turn around and come flooding back to the American homeland. It's a scenario that ends the American standard of living overnight. 11. When the dollars come flooding home, we need to talk about the scariest ghost story in economics. It's not a crash. It's not a recession. It is a phenomenon that happens when an empire finally loses its grip on the world reserve currency status. It's called the reflux. To understand this, you have to realize that for the last 50 years, the United States biggest export hasn't been cars or movies or airplanes. Our biggest export has been inflation. Think of the US dollar like a product. We manufacture it, print it [music] for free. We then sell it to the rest of the world in exchange for their coffee, their oil, their Toyotaas, and their electronics. This has been a fantastic deal for us. We get the stuff, they get the paper. As a result, there are trillions of US dollars floating around outside the United States. I'm not just talking about the cash in a drug lord's basement in Mexico or the bills in a tourist's wallet in Paris. I'm talking about the massive digital reserves held by foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and international corporations. These are what economists call euro dollars. It is a massive pool of money that lives offshore. It never touches the US economy. It stays out there facilitating global trade, greasing the gears of the world machine. As long as those dollars stay out there, they don't cause inflation in here. They are like water behind a dam. The dam is built out of confidence, the belief that the dollar is the safest place to store wealth. But what happens if the dam breaks? What happens if the Saudis, the Chinese, the Brazilians, and the Indians all decide at the same time that they don't want to hold these dollars anymore? What if they decide they would rather hold gold or yuan or copper mines or farmland? They start selling their dollars. But here is the problem. Who do they sell them to? If nobody in the rest of the world wants them, those dollars have only one place left to go. They have to come home. They return to the United States to buy American assets. Now, imagine this scenario. It's Tuesday in 2027. [music] The news breaks that Saudi Arabia has officially dumped the dollar for all oil sales. Panic sweeps the global markets. Foreign nations rush to liquidate their US Treasury bonds. Trillions of dollars flood back into the US domestic economy. These foreign entities don't want to just hold the cash. They want to trade it for something tangible before the value drops to zero. They start buying everything. [music] They buy American farmland. They buy American real estate. They buy shares of Apple and Microsoft. They buy machinery. [music] They buy grain. Suddenly, you have trillions of new dollars chasing the same amount of goods that existed yesterday. This is the textbook definition of hyperinflation. But it's not the good kind of inflation where your stocks go up and you feel rich. It's the destructive kind. Imagine going to the grocery store. A loaf of bread was $4 yesterday. Today, because a Chinese hedge fund just bought the entire wheat futures market to dump their dollars, bread is $12. Next week, it's $20. Your paycheck, however, stays the same. You see, when a currency dies, it doesn't happen linearly. It happens exponentially. It's like a game of musical chairs played by giants. The moment the music stops, confidence [music] breaks. Everyone rushes for a seat. real assets. The tragedy of this scenario is that the American people will be the last to know. The billionaire class knows this is coming. That's why Mark Zuckerberg is building a $100 million bunker in Hawaii. That's why Bill Gates is the largest owner of private farmland in the US. [music] They are trading their paper fiat currency for hard assets that will survive the flood. But the average American, you have your savings in a bank account. You have a 401k filled with bonds. You're holding the bag. When the dollars come home, the standard of living in the United States collapses. We are used to consuming far more than we produce because the world subsidizes us. We run a trade deficit. We import cheap [music] goods. If the dollar loses its value, those imports become unaffordable. That cheap t-shirt from Vietnam, it's now $50. That iPhone, it's $5,000. That gallon of gas, $15. We would be forced to live within our means for the first time in a century. And let me tell you, living within our means is going to feel like absolute poverty compared to what we are used to. This is the third worldification of America. You see it in Argentina. You see it in Turkey. It starts with inflation, then shortages, [music] then social unrest. The scary part is that we don't produce enough stuff to soak up all those returning dollars. We de-industrialized. We sold our factories. So when the money comes back, there are no goods to buy, only bidding wars for what's left. This brings us to a terrifying realization. The US government might actually want this to happen, at least partially. Why? Because inflation is the only way to pay off that $35 trillion debt we talked about. If you owe $35 trillion and you destroy the value of the dollar by 50%. [music] You effectively cut your debt in half in real terms. You pay back your bond holders with worthless paper. It's a soft default. It screws the savers to save the data. The victims of this crime will be the retirees, the pension funds, and the middle class. The people who followed the rules, saved their money, and trusted the system. So, if the paper money is destined to burn, where is the smart money going? What is the one asset that central banks are buying frantically while they tell you to buy stocks? In the next [music] section, we're going to look at the barbarous relic, the shiny yellow metal that Wall Street mocks, but which is quietly being hoarded by the very people plotting the dollar's demise. It's time to talk about gold's revenge. 12. Gold's revenge and the buying spree. If you watch CNBC or listen to your financial adviser, they have probably told you the same thing for the last 20 years. Don't buy gold. Gold is a pet rock. It doesn't pay dividends. It sits there and does nothing. It's a barbarous relic from a primitive past. They tell you to buy tech stocks. They tell you to buy bonds. They tell you to trust the digital numbers on the screen. But here is the golden rule of finance. Watch what they do, not what they say. While Western economists were busy mocking gold bugs on Twitter, the people who actually run the global financial system, the central bankers, were engaging in the most aggressive buying spree in human history. Let's look at the numbers because they don't lie. In 2022, global central banks bought 1,136 tons of gold. That was the highest level of net purchases on record going back to 1950. In 2023, they nearly matched it again, buying over 1,000 tons. Who is buying? It's not the United States. It's not Great Britain. The buyers are the revolt we've been talking about all video. The biggest buyer is the People's Bank of China. The second tier includes Poland, Singapore, India, and Turkey. Why? Why are these sophisticated modern nations frantically trading their valuable US dollars for useless lumps of metal? Because they know the storm is coming. Gold is the only financial asset on Earth that is not someone else's liability. If you hold a Treasury bond, that is a promise that the US government will pay you. If you hold a dollar, that is a generic liability of the Federal Reserve. If you hold a stock, you rely on the company's performance. But if you hold a bar of gold, you don't need anyone to promise you anything. It just is. It is value crystallized. For the global south, the lesson of the Russia sanctions was traumatic. They realized that if their wealth was stored in dollars, it could be deleted with a keystroke. But you cannot delete a gold bar sitting in a vault in Shanghai. You cannot sanction a gold coin in a pocket in Mumbai. Gold is financial sovereignty. But there is a deeper, darker story here that the mainstream media almost never covers. It involves a boring bureaucratic rule change that happened in Switzerland which effectively remonetized gold for the first time since 1971. It's called Beasel the I know [music] it sounds like a bad movie sequel, but stick with me because this is the plumbing that runs the world. The Bank for International Settlements, the Central Bank of Central Banks, sets the rules for how much capital banks need to hold to be considered safe. For decades, gold was classified as a tier 3 asset. That meant it was considered risky. Banks couldn't count physical gold as a full equivalent to cash. It was discriminated against in favor of US Treasury bonds. But recently, under the new Bassel 3 regulations, physical gold was reclassified as a tier 1 asset. This is a massive deal. It means that for the biggest banks in the world, gold is now officially considered risk-free just like cash. It means banks can hold gold to meet their solvency requirements. This quietly incentivized banks around the world to stop holding so much paper debt and start holding [music] physical metal. It was a silent admission by the global elite that the debt experiment is failing and they need to put a solid floor underneath the banking system before it collapses. And let's talk about China again because they are playing a game of hideand seek with their gold reserves. Officially, China says they have about 2200 tons of gold. That's a lot, but it's far less than the US, which claims 8100 tons, but almost no serious analyst believes the Chinese number. Here is why. China is the world's largest producer of gold. They mine about 400 tons a year, and crucially, they do not export any of it. What happens in China stays in China. On top of that, they are the world's largest importer. Thousands of tons flow into Shanghai and Hong Kong every year. If you do the math, mining plus imports minus consumption, many experts estimate that China's real gold hoe is likely over 20,000 tons. That would be more than double the US reserves. Why would they lie? Why hide it? Because of the golden rule, he who has the gold makes the rules. If China announces tomorrow that they have 20,000 tons of gold, the price of gold would skyrocket to $5,000 or $10,000 an ounce overnight, [music] that would be great for them, but it would also devalue the billions of US they still hold. They're accumulating quietly, keeping [music] the price suppressed, filling their vaults before they pull the rug. They are preparing for the moment when the current fiat system resets. History shows us that every 80 to 100 years, the monetary system collapses and resets. 1914 the classical gold standard ends. 1944 the Bretonwood system begins. 1971 the gold window closes. The petro dollar begins. 202x the [music] petrod dollar ends. And what begins? The bricks nations are hinting at a new currency backed by a basket of commodities. Oil, wheat, copper, and gold. If that happens, the US dollar, which is backed by nothing but $35 trillion in debt and political promises, will face a crisis of confidence unlike anything we have seen. And it's not just the East. Look at what Western allies are doing. In recent years, countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria have demanded to repatriate their gold. For decades, these countries kept their gold in the vaults of the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. It was safer there during the Cold War, but recently they asked for it back. They wanted the physical metal flown back to Frankfurt and Vienna. Why? If you trust your ally, you leave your wallet at his house. If you demand your wallet back, it means the trust is gone. It means you want to make sure the gold is actually there. Fun fact, when Germany asked for their gold back from the US, it took years to deliver. And the bars they received had different serial numbers than the ones they deposited. This fueled massive conspiracy theories that the US didn't actually have the gold and had to scramble to buy or lease it to pay Germany back. Whether that's true or not, the optics were terrible. This is the run on the bank at a sovereign level. So, what does this mean for you? It means that while the media tells you gold is a relic, the smartest, most powerful entities on the planet are acting like it is the only [music] lifeboat on the Titanic. They are swapping their paper tickets, dollars, for life vests, gold. They know that when the debt spiral we discussed in the last section finally spins out of control, the only thing that will retain value is the one thing governments cannot print. But as the dollar loses its status, it's not just our savings that are at risk. It is our safety. The American Empire is built on a military machine that spans the globe. 800 bases in 70 countries, 11 aircraft carrier strike groups. It is a logistical behemoth that requires an infinite stream of money to operate. If the money printer breaks, the machine stops. In the next section, we going to explore the terrifying geopolitical reality of a broke superpower. What happens to the US military when we can no longer afford to pay the soldiers, fuel the jets, or maintain the bases? The end of the petro dollar doesn't just mean expensive groceries. It means the end of the Pax Americana 13. The end of infinite war funding. There is a saying that amateurs talk strategy but professionals talk logistics and the most important part of logistics is paying for it. The United States military is the most expensive organization in human history. We spend roughly $850 billion a year on defense. That is more than the next 10 countries combined. We maintain 750 to 800 military bases in over 70 nations. We have 11 aircraft carrier strike groups patrolling the seven seas for the last 80 years. This massive machine has guaranteed global trade. It keeps the pirates away from the shipping lanes. It keeps the oil flowing through the straight of Hormuse. It is the muscle behind the rules-based international order. But here is the dirty secret of American military power. We haven't actually paid for it in decades. We didn't pay for the Iraq war with taxes. We didn't pay for the 20 years in Afghanistan with war bonds. We paid for them with debt. We swiped the national credit card, printed the money, and let inflation handle the rest. We could do this because of the petro dollar. Because the world needed dollars, the world bought our debt. Essentially, China and Saudi Arabia subsidized the very military [music] that was designed to encircle them. It was a strategic absurdity that they tolerated because it was profitable. But as the petro dollar dies, that subsidy ends. And when the subsidy ends, the American Empire faces a Suez moment. Let me give you a history lesson that every American needs to hear. The year was 1956. Great Britain was still a global superpower. They controlled the Suez Canal in Egypt, a vital artery for global trade. When Egypt tried to nationalize the canal, Britain, France, and Israel invaded to take it back. Militarily, Britain could have easily won. But they had a problem. They were broke. [music] They were in debt from World War II. President Eisenhower didn't want the war to happen. So, he didn't send troops to stop the British. He sent bankers. He told the British government that if they didn't withdraw, the US would sell its massive holdings of British pounds. He threatened to crash their currency and destroy their economy. Britain had no choice. They withdrew. They were humiliated. And in that moment, the world knew the British Empire was dead. Not because they lost a battle, but [music] because they lost the checkbook. The United States is now staring down the barrel of its own Suez moment. If we enter a major conflict, say over Taiwan, and we need to print $5 trillion to fund it, but nobody buys our bonds, what happens? We would have to monetize that debt instantly. Hyperinflation would rip through the US economy within weeks. The cost of fuel for the jets, steel for the ships, and salaries for the soldiers would spiral out of control. We're already seeing the cracks. The US military is facing a massive recruitment crisis. They can't find enough people willing to serve. Why? Part of it is cultural, sure, but part of it is economic. A private salary doesn't buy what it used to. In a post-petetrodoll world, the US will be forced to make a choice. The welfare state or the warfare state. We cannot afford both. When the interest on the debt hits 2 trillion or 3 trillion a year, the budget math breaks. We will have to close bases. [music] We will have to bring the fleets home. We will have to stop being the world police. For some of you watching, that sounds great. Bring the troops home. Focus on America. But be careful what you wish for. When the US Navy stops patrolling the oceans, who takes over? The oceans don't stay empty. Piracy returns. Regional warlords take control of shipping lanes. Insurance rates for cargo ships skyrocket. The cost of everything you import, from coffee to computer chips goes up. [music] We are moving from a unipolar world, one cop, to a multipolar world, gang warfare. This brings us to the landscape of the future. If the dollar isn't the king and the US military isn't the enforcer, what does the map look like? It doesn't look like Star Trek with one united planet. It looks more like Game of Thrones. In the next section, we're going to map out the multipolar currency world. It's a fractured, messy, and inefficient future where where you live determines what money you spend and where globalization goes to die. 14. The multipolar currency world. For the last 30 years, we have lived in the era of hyper globalization. It was a world without friction. You could sit in your underwear in Chicago, click a button on Amazon, and 3 days later, a package would arrive containing a gadget made in Shenzhen using cobalt from Congo and microchips from Taiwan. You didn't care about the currency exchange rates. You didn't care about the trade treaties. You just paid in dollars and the magic happened. That world is dead. is being replaced by something far more complicated, far more expensive, and far more dangerous. Welcome to the multipolar currency world. If the old world was like the worldwide web, one open network where everyone could talk to everyone. The new [music] world is the splinter. It is a series of walled gardens, firewalls, and gated communities. In this future, there is no single king of money. The US dollar doesn't disappear. It doesn't vanish into thin air, but it shrinks. It becomes just one of several regional warlords fighting for territory. We are seeing the formation of three distinct economic blocks. The dollar block, the United States, [music] Canada, the UK, Australia, and parts of Latin America. The Euro block, the European Union, and its periphery, though they are increasingly caught in the middle. the bricks block, China, Russia, India, the Middle East, and huge swavthes of Africa. This is what economists call economic balconization. Let's simulate what it's actually like to do business in this fragmented world. Imagine you're an American manufacturer in 2030. You want to buy specialized machinery from China. In the old days, you sent a wire transfer in dollars. Easy. But now, China imposes capital controls. They demand payment in digital yuan. Your American bank under pressure from US regulators refuses to process a transaction in the currency of a strategic adversary. You are stuck. You have to find a middleman. Maybe you route the money through a bank in Singapore or Dubai. You convert dollars to Dirhams, then Durhams to Yuan. Each step takes a fee. Each step takes time. Each step carries political risk. The machine that used to cost $50,000 now costs $85,000 and takes 6 months to arrive because of compliance checks. This is the death of efficiency. For decades, the dollar system made the world efficient. It greased the gears. By removing the grease, we're introducing sand into the engine of the global economy. This means the end of the deflationary era. The efficiency dividend, the phenomenon that made t-shirts and TVs cheaper every year, is over. When you break global supply chains into political blocks, costs go up. Period. We are moving from just in time manufacturing to just in case manufacturing. Companies can no longer source materials from the cheapest provider. They have to source from the friendliest provider. This is called friend shoring. If you are Apple, you can't just build iPhones in China anymore. You have to move factories to India or Vietnam or bring them back to the US. That sounds patriotic, but it is massively inflationary. An American worker costs 10 times what a Chinese worker costs. So in a multipolar world, you, the consumer, pay the geopolitical tax. But the scariest part of this new world isn't the price of iPhones. It's the return of mercantalism. In a world where you can't trust the currency, [music] trade starts to look a lot like Barta. We are already seeing this. In 2023, Pakistan wanted to buy Russian oil, but they didn't have dollars, and Russia didn't want Pakistani rupees. So, what did they do? They discussed trading oranges and wheat for fuel. Iran and Sri Lanka recently settled a trade deal using tea for oil. This is the future. I'll give you three tanker ships of LG if you build me a railway. I'll give you rare earth minerals if you give me semiconductor technology. It is a raw brute force economy where real assets matter more than financial derivatives. [music] In the dollar world, the guy with the most credit was king. In the multipolar world, the guy with the most stuff is king. Russia has energy. China has manufacturing capacity. Brazil has [music] food. Australia has minerals. What does the US have? We have the best software, the best universities, and the deepest financial markets. But you can't eat software. and you can't heat your home with a derivative contract. This shift puts the United States in a vulnerable position. We are a net importer of physical goods. We rely on the rest of the world to feed us and clothe us. If the global south decides to hoard their resources within their own trading block, the shelves at Walmart start looking very empty. This is also a world of currency volatility. In the past, major currencies moved 1% or 2% a year against each other. In a fragmented world, you could see 20% swings in a month. If the bricks announce a goldbacked note, the dollar could plummet 15% overnight. If the US sanctions China, the UN could gyate wildly. For a regular person trying to save for retirement, [music] this is a nightmare. How do you plan for the future when the measuring stick money keeps changing length? You can't just save money anymore because money is the thing that is under attack. This brings us to the final most important question of this entire series. We have diagnosed the disease. We have traced the history from the secret meetings in 1974 to the gold vaults of 2024. We have shown you the cracks in the dam. So what do you do? You are not a central banker. You're not a prime minister. You cannot stop the petro dollar from dying. You cannot stop the debt from exploding. But you can build an arg. In the final section, we're going to pivot from the macro to the micro. We're going to give you the practical actionable playbook on how to position your personal finances for the [music] postdoll era. We will talk about asset allocation, self-custody, and the mindset shift you need to survive the transition. The world is changing. Don't let your wealth die with the old system. 15. Preparing for the postdoll era. We have covered a lot of ground today. We've traveled from the secret meeting rooms of Jeder in 1974 to the digital battlefields of the future. We've looked at the $35 trillion debt bomb and the nations plotting to detonate it. If you've made it this far, you might be feeling a mix of emotions. Fear, anger, helplessness. That is a normal reaction. When you realize the ground beneath your feet, the very money you use to buy food is shifting. It's terrifying. But I want you to take a deep breath. Panic is expensive. Panic makes you sell at the bottom and buy at the top. Panic makes you vulnerable to scammers selling survival buckets and doomsday bunkers. We are not here to panic. We are here to prepare. The death of the petrod dollar doesn't mean the world ends. It doesn't mean the sun won't rise tomorrow. It just means the rules of the game are changing. And if you know the new rules, you can win. Here is your survival guide for the post dollar era. Step one, fire your mental accountant. The first thing you need to do is change your mindset. Stop measuring your wealth in dollars. If your house goes up in price from $400,000 to $600,000, did you get richer or did the dollar just get weaker? If a loaf of bread costs twice as much, did the bread get twice as delicious? No. In a hyperinflationary or stagflationary environment, the nominal price of everything goes up. You might feel rich because your stock portfolio is up 10%. But if inflation is 12%, [music] you are losing purchasing power. Stop chasing more dollars. Start chasing purchasing power. Ask yourself, can this asset buy me more eggs, more fuel, and more land in 10 years than it can today? Step two, the death of the 60/40 portfolio. For 40 years, financial advisers have told you to put 60% of your money in stocks and 40% in bonds. In the post-doll era, bonds are dead money. Think about it. A US Treasury bond is a contract where you lend money to the government for 10 or 30 years. In exchange, they pay you interest. But as we discussed, the government has to inflate the currency to pay its debt. If they are paying you 4% interest, but inflation is running at 6% or 8%, you are locking in a guaranteed loss. You're slowly bleeding to death. In a world of sovereign default and currency debasement, lending money to the government is not risk-free. It is returnfree risk. You need to pivot from paper assets, bonds, cash, insurance annuities to hard assets. Step three, get your insurance, gold and silver. I am not telling you to put 100% of your net worth into gold bars and bury them in the backyard. That's paranoia. But having 0% is financial negligence. Gold is your insurance policy against the central bank losing control. It is the only asset that has survived every currency collapse in the last 5,000 years. [music] Aim for a prudent allocation. 5% 10% [music] maybe 15% of your net worth. And here is the critical part. If you can't touch it, you don't own it. Do not buy paper gold ETFs like GLD if you're worried about a systemic collapse. In a crisis, those paper claims might be settled in cash, not metal. Buy physical coins by bars. Keep some at home in a safe and some in a private non-bank vault. Silver is the volatile little brother of gold. It has industrial utility, solar panels, electronics, and monetary history. In a currency crisis, silver often outperforms gold because it's more accessible to the average person for barter. Step four, the digital lifeboat, Bitcoin. I know, I know some of you hate crypto. You think it's a scam. And 99% of crypto is a scam. It's gambling. But Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin was created specifically for this scenario. It was born in 2008 out of the financial crisis as a response to money printing. It is the only asset in the world with a fixed supply. There will only ever be 21 million. No politician can print more. No central bank can dilute it. [music] It is digital, portable, and unseasable if you hold your own keys. In a world of capital controls, where governments try to stop you from moving your money across borders, [music] Bitcoin is a teleporter for wealth. You can memorize 12 words, your seed phrase, cross a border with nothing in your pockets, and access your entire net worth on the other side. Even if you are skeptical, a small 1% to 5% allocation is a rational asymmetric bet [music] against the dollar system. Step five, productive real assets. Gold and Bitcoin are great, but they don't produce anything. They just sit there. To build wealth, you need assets that yield real estate. But be careful. Residential real estate in the US is in a bubble. Look for cash flowing rental properties, farmland or timberland. Farmland is historically one of the best hedges against inflation. People always need to eat stocks. Do not buy the entire market S&P 500 blindly. In an inflationary world, many zombie companies will go bankrupt. You want to own companies with pricing power. These are companies that can raise their prices when their costs go up and customers still have to buy from them. Think energy companies, consumer staples, commodities producers, and defense contractors. Step six, debt is a weapon. Debt destroys you in inflation, but it can make you rich in inflation if you use it right. If you have fixed rate debt, like a 30-year mortgage at 3%, [music] do not pay it off early. That is good debt. Why? Because you are paying the bank back with cheaper debase dollars. If inflation hits 10% and your loan is 3%, the bank is effectively paying you to live in your house. The real value of your debt is shrinking every year. However, variable rate debt, credit cards, adjustable rate mortgages is suicide. Pay that off immediately. The moment interest rates spike to defend the dollar, those payments will crush you. Step seven, the ultimate [music] asset, you. Finally, the most important hedge against a collapsing currency is your ability to produce value. If the dollar collapses, the guy with $1 million in the bank is poor. The guy who knows how to fix a generator, grow food, suture a wound, or code in Python is rich. Invest in skills. Invest in your health. Invest in a network of trusted friends and family. In a multipolar, fragmented world, community is the ultimate safety net. Final thoughts. The petrod dollar system wasn't evil. It was just a mechanism. It gave the United States 50 years of unparalleled prosperity. It allowed us to win the Cold War. It allowed us to build a middle class. But nothing lasts forever. The mechanism is broken. The world is moving on. You can mourn the old world or you can position yourself for the new one. The transition will be volatile. It will be messy. There will be winners and losers. The losers will be the ones holding the bag of paper promises. The winners will be the ones holding hard assets. Real skills and independent minds. The slow death of the petro dollar isn't the end of the story. It's just the turning of the page. Make sure you are the one writing your next chapter.

6. The Venezuela Economy That Nailed Maduro (The Verdict)

The year is 2026. Nicholas Maduro is in a holding cell in Brooklyn. But let's get one thing straight before the history books dry the ink on this chapter. It wasn't just a Delta Force operation that took him down. It wasn't just a political deal. The handcuffs you saw on the news on January 2026. They were forged 10 years ago. They were forged by an economic catastrophe so complete, so mathematically impossible that it turned the wealthiest nation in South America into a crime scene. Imagine you're sitting on a literal swimming pool of gold. You have more oil than Saudi Arabia. You have paradise beaches, fertile land, and an educated population. And then you starve. You don't just go broke, you delete 80% of your economy in a decade. How do you lose $100 billion without building a single bridge? How do you make a cup of coffee cost $3 million? Today, we aren't just looking at the arrest. We are looking at the bill. This is the forensic audit of the most spectacular financial suicide in modern history. This is economy that nailed Maduro. The final verdict, won the black gold trap, or how to win the lottery and still go broke. To understand why Maduro is sitting in a cell today, we have to go back to the moment the trap was set. It starts with a number 300 billion. That is roughly the number of barrels of proven oil reserves under Venezuelan soil. It is the largest stash on planet Earth. Bigger than the Saudis, bigger than the US. It is a geological lottery ticket that should have made every single Venezuelan a millionaire. But here is the dirty little secret of economics. Oil is a jealous god. When Maduro took the wheel in 2013 following [music] the death of Hugo Chavez, he inherited a car that was already smoking under the hood. For years, the government had been infected with a severe case of Dutch disease. If you skipped econ 101, [music] here's the explain it like I'm five version. When you make so much money selling oil, your currency gets super strong. That makes it incredibly cheap to import stuff from other countries. Why grow tomatoes in Venezuela when you can buy them from Brazil for pennies? Why build cars when you can import Toyotas? [music] So Venezuela stopped making things. They stopped farming. They stopped manufacturing. They just pumped oil, sold it, and bought everything else. It worked great. As long as oil was $100 a barrel, it was a party. A lavish, drunken, endless party. But Maduro didn't just inherit a dependency on oil. He inherited a broken pump. Years before, in a moment of ego that would doom the nation, the government had fired nearly 20,000 engineers and geologists from PDVSA, the state oil company. Why? Because they went on strike. They were replaced by political loyalists, people who knew a lot about chanting slogans but very little about maintaining high-press subterranean pipes. By the time Maduro sat in the big chair, the infrastructure was rotting, pumps were rusting, pipelines were leaking, but he needed the cash to keep the party going. So instead of fixing the rigs, he raided the piggy bank. He treated PDVSA like a personal ATM. Need money for a rally? Take it from the oil company? Need to pay off a general? Take it from the oil company. Maintenance budget delete. Here is the first nail in the coffin. Production collapse. When Maduro took office, Venezuela was pumping nearly 3 million barrels a day. By the time the handcuffs went on yesterday, that number had struggled to stay above 800,000 for years. And at its lowest point in 2020, it hit a pathetic 337,000. Imagine you own a bakery. You stop buying flour. You fire the bakers. [music] You sell the ovens for scrap metal. And then you act surprised when you have no bread to sell. That is the Maduro economic doctrine. He killed the golden goose, plucked it, deep fried it, and then wondered why it stopped laying eggs. But when the oil money stopped flowing in 2014, surely he cut spending, right? Surely he tightened the belt. Oh, my sweet summer child. No, he did something much, much worse to the money printer. go bru. The inflationary suicide. The year is 2014. Oil prices crash. The ATM runs out of cash. The government has billions in bills to pay. Social programs, subsidies, debt, and the loyalty of the military. A normal government would raise taxes or cut spending. Maduro. He looked at the central bank and said, "Print [music] it." This wasn't just inflation. This was hyperinflation. This was economic velocity that broke the speedometer. Let's look at the stats because they are genuinely hard to comprehend. In 2013, inflation was a worrying 56%. Bad but manageable. By 2015, 180%. By 2016, 2 sat 54%. And then the dam broke. In 2018, the IMF and the Venezuelan National Assembly estimated inflation hit 130,000%. Some estimates for early 2019 put it over 300,000%. Let me put that in perspective. Imagine you go to sleep on Monday and this egg costs $1. By Friday, this egg cost $3,000. Prices weren't changing by the year or the month. They were changing by the hour. Waiters in restaurants wouldn't give you a menu with prices because by the time you finished your appetizer, the price of the steak had doubled. The currency, the believer, became literally worthless. It was cheaper to use the bills as napkins than [music] to buy napkins with them. People started weaving purses out of the cash because the craft value was higher than the face value. And what was Maduro's verdict on this? Did he admit the mistake? No. He declared an economic war. He blamed shopkeepers. He blamed the CIA. He blamed checks notes. Spider-Man? Okay, maybe not Spider-Man, but he blamed the capitalist parasites. He sent the military to force shopkeepers to lower prices. Sell this TV for $10, the soldiers would say. So, the shopkeeper sold the TV for $10. And then he had no money to buy a new TV to sell. The shelves went empty. This is the second nail, the destruction of price. An economy relies on one thing. Trust. Trust that. Trust. This piece of paper is worth something. Trust that if I sell a shoe today, I can buy bread tomorrow. Maduro took that trust and set it on fire. By destroying the currency, he turned every transaction into a panic attack. People spent their paychecks the second they got them buying anything. Tires, rice, bleach. Because holding money was like holding melting ice. But if you think losing your savings is bad, wait until you hear what happened to the food. Because when the money dies, the hunger begins. And that is where the story turns from a financial tragedy into a humanitarian horror show. Three, the hunger games, the weaponization of food. In 2016, a dark joke started circulating on the streets of Karacas. [music] It was called the Maduro diet. The punchline, it gets you skinny, but it doesn't make you fit. It wasn't funny, but when you're starving, humor is the only nutrient you have left. According to the Enco survey, a major university study in Venezuela, in 2016 alone, nearly 75% of the population lost an average of 19 lb. Not because they were hitting the gym, [music] but because they were skipping meals. This is nail number three, the weaponization of scarcity. You see, when the economy crashed, the supermarket shelves went bare. But the government found a solution. They created something called the clap boxes local produion. This cardboard box became the most powerful political tool in the country. It was a subsidized food package delivered directly to households. On paper, it sounds like a relief effort. Indium reality. It was a leash. If you protested against Maduro, no box for you. If you didn't sign the party list, no box for you. If you lived in a neighborhood that voted for the opposition, maybe the truck [music] breaks down that week. But the forensic audit gets darker. This wasn't just about control. It was about theft. Remember a guy named Alex Sar? He was Maduro's financial fixer, the guy who was swapped in a prisoner exchange with the US back in 2023. Investigations revealed that the government was importing this low-quality food, often unfit for human consumption at massive markups. They were buying powdered milk from Mexico that had virtually no nutritional value, billing the Venezuelan state millions for it and pocketing the difference. While Venezuelan children were fainting in schools from malnutrition, the regime's inner circle was getting rich off the very hunger they created. They turned starvation into a business model. Think about the level of cynicism required for that. You destroy the farm so people can't grow food. You destroy the currency so they can't buy food. And then you say, "Don't worry, I'll feed you if you kneel." This economic crime did something the opposition parties never could. [music] It broke the spirit of the working class. You can't fight a revolution on an empty stomach. For the great escape, voting with their feet. When a house is on fire, you don't debate the architectural merits of the roof. You jump out the window. By 2018, Venezuela wasn't just on fire. It was an inferno. And the people made a choice. If they couldn't vote Maduro out with a ballot, they would vote with their feet. This is nail number four, the human capital hemorrhage. Since 2014, roughly 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country. That is about 25% of the entire population. Let me contextualize that for you. Imagine if every single person in Texas just left or if the entire country of Switzerland packed up and moved. This is the largest displacement crisis in the history of the Western Hemisphere. Bigger than Syria at points. And unlike Syria, there was no foreign invasion. There were no bombs falling. The bomb was the economic policy we just talked about. And who left? Everyone. but specifically the people you need to run a country. Doctors, engineers, teachers, oil technicians. I want you to picture a hospital in Caracus in 2019. The power goes out because the electrical grid failed. We'll get to that. The backup generator doesn't work because the parts were stolen. And the surgeon, he's not there. He's in Miami washing dishes because his surgeon's salary in Venezuela dropped to $6 a month. This is the hidden cost that nailed Maduro in the long run. He didn't just lose money, he lost the brains to fix the money. When the oil rigs broke down, the guys who knew how to fix them were in Houston. When the power grid collapsed, the electrical engineers were in Madrid. He was left ruling a country of ghosts and the elderly. And the desperation reached biblical proportions. We saw hundreds of thousands of people walking, walking through the Darian Gap, one of the most dangerous jungles on Earth, just for a chance to get to the US border. This mass exodus did two things. It relieved pressure initially, fewer mouths to feed, but eventually it humiliated the regime on the global stage. You can scream socialist paradise all you want, but when a quarter of your population would rather risk death in a jungle than stay in your paradise, the verdict is already in. The economy didn't just drive them out, it exiled them. And now those millions of voices in the diaspora became the loudest lobby against him. They were the ones sending remittances back home, literally keeping their families alive with $20 transfers while simultaneously begging the world to intervene. But if you think the people leaving was the end of the collapse, you're missing the loudest crash of all. The moment the lights went out, literally. Five. The day the earth stood still, the infrastructure collapse. Imagine this. You're in an elevator on the 20th floor. Or you're on a subway train deep underground. Or you're a surgeon, scalpel in hand, about to make an incision. And then click. In March 2019, Venezuela went dark. Not for an hour, not for a day, for nearly [music] a week. This was the great blackout. The Guri Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric plants in the world, which supplies 80% of the country's power, failed. Why was it an electromagnetic pulse weapon fired by space aliens? Was it a sniper? According to Maduro, yes, he blamed a cybernetic attack orchestrated by the US and Senator Marco Rubio. He literally claimed they hacked the dam from a laptop in Washington. But the engineers, the few who were left, knew the truth. The verdict, negligence. Remember those 20,000 fired oil workers? Well, the same thing happened to the electrical grid. They stopped cutting the grass around the substations, leading to fires. They stopped replacing the turbines. They let the system rot until it simply gave up. This is nail number five. The infrastructure apocalypse. It wasn't just the lights. When the power died, the water pump stopped. You're in a tropical country. 90° F, no air conditioning, no fans, and now no water coming out of the tap. People were seen scooping water from the Gu River, a river so polluted it's basically liquid sewage, just to flush their toilets or wash their clothes. But the true horror was in the hospitals. Neonatal incubators turned off. Dialysis machines stopped. We will never know the exact death toll of those 5 days. But doctors reported patients dying simply because the machines keeping them alive had no juice. This was the moment the economy stopped being about numbers and became a physical threat to life. The state had failed to provide the two most basic things a civilization needs, light and water. And yet, and [music] in a twist of irony that would make a Hollywood writer blush, the regime found a way to survive. They realized the believer was dead. So to stay in power, they had to embrace the one thing they hated most. Six. The devil's deal. Dollarization and the bordon bubble. By 2020, Venezuela was officially the Twilight Zone. Walk down one street and you see people digging through trash bags for food. Walk down the next street and you see a shiny new store called a Bodagon selling Nutella, Kirkland Signature Vitamins, PlayStation 5s, and imported champagne. This is nail number six, the zombie economy. After years of screaming Yankee go home, Maduro did the unthinkable. He quietly legalized the US dollar. He stopped trying to control the exchange rate because he literally couldn't anymore. He let the dollar flow. Suddenly, Venezuela became a two-tier society. Tier one, the 95% of people earning Bolivars worth nothing. Tier 2, the 5% government cronies, military generals, and people with family abroad who had dollars. This created [music] a bubble of luxury in Caracus. New restaurants opened with $100 stakes. Casinos reopened. It gave the illusion that things were getting better. Look, the influencers said, Venezuela is fixed. But it was a mirage. It was an economy built on money laundering and remittances. The government wasn't producing anything. They were just washing dirty cash through luxury imports. Speaking of printing money, unfortunately, YouTube doesn't let me print cash. But if you hit that subscribe button, it tells the algorithm that this forensic analysis is worth watching. It helps the channel, and frankly, it's [music] free, unlike a jar of Nutella and Caracus which cost 15. But wait, if the oil industry was dead and they weren't collecting taxes, where was the regime getting the actual cash to buy loyalty? How do you pay a general to keep him from arresting you? You turn to the oldest currency in the world, gold. And I don't mean the clean kind stored in a vault. Seven. The arcom echide for cash. When the oil dried up, Maduro looked at a map of the Venezuelan Amazon, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, and said, "Dig it up." He created the Oronoko mining ark. Arcom Monero, a zone bigger than Portugal, opened up for gold mining. But this wasn't industrial mining with safety standards. This was the wild west. This is nail number seven, the gangster economy. The regime handed control of these mines to a mix of the military and actual criminal syndicates, including Colombian guerrillas like the ELN. They use mercury, poisonous, toxic mercury, to separate the gold from the dirt. That [music] mercury flows into the rivers, poisoning the water for indigenous tribes and killing the fish. The gold is then flown out, often on private planes, to places like Turkey, the UAE, or Iran. It's sold for cash off the books. No receipts, no taxes, just bags of cash delivered to the presidential palace to keep the inner circle happy. This is crucial to understand. By 2024 and 2025, Venezuela wasn't a state anymore. It was a criminal enterprise pretending to be a country. The economy wasn't based on GDP. It was based on extraction. Extract the oil. What's left? Extract the gold. Extract the money from migrants. Extract the hope. But even crime pays the bills for only so long. Because eventually you run out of things to steal and you run out of friends to protect you. Which brings us to the final months. The election that wasn't and the mistake that finally snapped the trap shut. Eight. The recovery hoax. The 2024 election trap. If you were following the news in 2023 and early 2024, you might have heard a whisper, a rumor. Venezuela is fixing itself. Inflation had slowed down slightly. Oil was flowing a bit more because the US eased some sanctions, the Chevron license. There was a deal on the table. The Barbados Agreement. The deal was simple. Hold a free election in July 2024 and the world will let you sell oil again. The economy could finally breathe. This is nail number eight. The opportunity cost of ego. July 28th, 2024. The day the economy could have been saved. The opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez didn't just win in the polls, he crushed it. We're talking a 7030 split in many estimates. The exit polls were screaming change. Maduro had a choice. Option A, accept defeat, negotiate an amnesty deal, retire to a beach in Turkey with his millions, and let the country recover. Option B, steal the vote, flip the table, and doom the economy to eternal isolation. He chose option B. He announced he won. He refused to show the voting tallies. He arrested the protesters. And just like that, the economic lifeline was cut. The US said, "Deals off. Sanctions snapped back. The foreign investors who were sniffing around packed their bags and left." This is the moment the verdict was truly signed. Because up until 2024, Maduro could blame imperialism. He could blame sanctions. But in 2024, he was given a golden key to unlock the sanctions and he threw it in the river. He proved to the world and more importantly to his own military that as long as he was in charge, Venezuela would never make money again. He was the blockage in the pipe. And when a general can't pay his troops because the president is radioactive, that's when the loyalty starts to rust. Nine. The cartel of the suns from president to kingpin. Now we arrive at the darkest part of the audit. When the oil economy died and the gold economy wasn't enough, the state turned to the most profitable commodity in South America, cocaine. This is nail number nine, the criminalization of the state. For years, US investigators tracked the cartel of the sons, cartel de los souls. Why sons? Because in the Venezuelan military, the generals wear sun insignas on their epolettes. The allegation, now the charge, is that the Venezuelan government essentially became the logistics department for drug trafficking. Imagine you are a drug lord. Usually, you have to hide from the police. Now, imagine you are the police. You control the radar. You control the ports. You control the airspace. It's the perfect business. But here is the economic catch. A narco state is unstable by nature. It invites heat. The US Department of Justice wasn't looking at Maduro as a politician anymore. They were looking at him like El Chapo. The $15 million bounty on his head turned him into a walking winning lottery ticket. Think about the psychology of that. Every time Maduro walked into a room with his bodyguards, he had to wonder, "Does that guy want to protect me or does he want the $15 million?" When the economy is bankrupt, loyalty has a price tag. And $15 million is a price tag that a lot of hungry soldiers might find very attractive. This criminal economy isolated him completely. Even his alleys, China, Brazil, the leftist governments in the region [music] started to distance themselves. Nobody wants to bank with a guy who has a DOJ indictment hanging over his neck. It's bad for business. So, as we entered late 2025, Maduro was alone. The oil money gone. The people gone or starving. The infrastructure dead. The military unpaid and tempted by the bounty. The walls were closing in. The economic reality had finally cornered the political [music] fantasy. And that brings us to the event of January 3rd, 2026. The final collapse. 10. The end of the line. When the checks bounced. History teaches us one undeniable lesson about dictatorships. You can survive being hated. You can survive being sanctioned. You can even survive a coup or two. But you cannot survive when your own bodyguards realize they have a better future without you. Why did it happen now? Why January 3rd, 2026? Because the economic math finally hit zero. Reports suggest that in the last few months of 2025, the cash payments to the top brass started to arrive late or they were lighter than usual. The gold mines were being squeezed. The drug routes were being intercepted by aggressive US patrols. The loot was running out. And that brings us to the ultimate economic concept, incentive structures. For 10 years, the incentive for the military was protect Maduro, get paid, stay safe. January 3rd, 2026, the incentive flipped. Protect Maduro, go down with the ship, hand him over, maybe get a plea deal, maybe keep some of the money. When the Delta Force teams landed, they didn't face a fanatical fight to the death defense from thousands of troops. They faced a regime that had already hollowed itself out. The structure was rotten. One kick and it all came down. The economy didn't just weaken him. It stripped him of his shield. It turned him from a leader into a liability. 11. The verdict. Forensic summary. So, here we are. The verdict is in. Nicholas Maduro is in a cell in Brooklyn. But let's be clear about what actually defeated him. It wasn't just a political ideology. It was a refusal to accept the laws of reality. He thought he could print wealth. He couldn't. He thought he could eat oil. He couldn't. He thought he could rule over ruins forever. He couldn't. Here is the final bill of the Maduro era. One, GDP contracted by nearly 80%. One of the worst economic collapses in peace time history. Two, poverty. At its peak, over 90% of the population lived in poverty. Three, migration. Nearly 8 million people, 25% of the country, forced into exile. And four, currency 14 deleted. A currency so worthless it ceased to exist. There will be trials. There will be lawyers. There will be headlines about justice. But there is no courtroom big enough to hold the true scale of what Venezuelans have been through. You cannot sue for a lost decade. You cannot refund a stolen childhood. You cannot put a price on the empty chairs at the dinner tables where 8 million people used to sit. The economy that nailed Maduro also nailed the Venezuelan people to a cross of suffering. He may be gone. The nightmare may be over. But the waking up, the rebuilding, that is going to be the hardest work of all. Venezuela is free of the man. [music] Now it must free itself from the wreckage he left behind. If you found this forensic deep dive valuable, do me a favor, hit that like button. It helps this video get past the algorithm and reach more people who need to understand the truth. And hit subscribe if you want to be here for the next chapter. Because trust me, the story of how Venezuela rebuilds, how it turns the lights back on, is going to be just as wild as the story of how they went out. I'll see you in the comments. And remember, economics isn't just about money. It's about [music] life.

7. Why the US Wants to BUY Greenland (It’s Not a Joke)

Imagine for a second that you are the president of the United States. You're sitting in the Oval Office staring at a map of the world and you realize something unsettling. Your rivals are moving faster. The ice is melting and there's a massive frozen blind spot sitting right in your strategic backyard. So, you do what any red-blooded capitalist superpower might do. You pick up the phone, call the prime minister of Denmark, and ask, "How much?" When Donald Trump floated the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, the world laughed. The media treated it like a fever dream. Denmark called the idea absurd. Late night hosts had a field day. But here's the twist most people missed while they were busy making memes. Trump wasn't the first American president to think this way. He was actually the third. The United States [music] has been seriously exploring the idea of acquiring Greenland for more than a century. from early discussions after the Alaska purchase in the 1860s to a formal hund00 million offer under President Truman in 1946. [music] And the reason isn't ego. It's about minerals. It's about military positioning. It's about control of the Arctic as the planet warms. Today, we're not talking about politics. [music] We're talking about the biggest real estate deal that never happened and why the United States remains fixated on making it happen. Welcome to the Arctic Cold War. One, the 100year obsession. It didn't start with Trump. Let's get one thing straight before we dive into the economics. The idea of buying Greenland didn't pop out of thin air in a 2019 headline. If you really want to understand America's fixation on this island, you have to go back to a time when men wore top hats and buying territory felt like shopping for used furniture. The year is 1867. The US Secretary [music] of State is William Seard, the same man who just bought Alaska from Russia for what critics called Seward's folly until gold and oil turned him into a visionary overnight. But Seward wanted more than Alaska. He commissioned internal State Department studies exploring the potential acquisition of Greenland and even Iceland. His logic was brutally strategic. Control key North Atlantic choke points, dominate shipping routes, and project American power deep into the Arctic. It was 19th century empire building logic. [music] Domestic politics eventually buried the idea, but the seed was planted. Fast forward to 1946. World War II is over. Europe is shattered. The Soviet Union is rising. And President Harry Truman understands that the next war won't be fought in trenches. [music] It will be fought in the sky with bombers flying over the Arctic. So Truman made a formal offer to Denmark. $100 million in gold, not paper money, not bonds, literal gold bullion. At the time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff described Greenlanders indispensable to the safety of the United States. If hostile bombers crossed the polar route, Greenland was the interception point. Without it, American cities would be dangerously exposed. Denmark politely and firmly declined. But the US didn't walk away. They changed tactics. If they couldn't buy the house, they would rent the guest room forever. In 1951, a defense agreement granted the US permanent military access to Greenland, a strategic foothold that still exists today. So, when headlines exploded, headlines. In 2019, the defense establishment wasn't laughing, they were nodding. And one more fun fact, Denmark has sold territory to the US before. In 1917, America bought the Danish West Indies for $25 million in gold, today known as the US Virgin Islands. So, the precedent isn't theoretical, it's historical. Two, the Gap. Why geography is destiny. Now, let's put on our admiral hats. If you look at a flat classroom map, Greenland looks like a distorted blob drifting at the top of the world. But if you look at a globe or a naval strategy chart, you see something very different. You see the G gap? That stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom. One of the most important naval choke points on Earth that almost nobody talks about at dinner parties. Imagine you're a Russian submarine captain. Your mission is to get a nuclear armed submarine from Arctic bases near Mammans into the open Atlantic where it could threaten North America. In most practical scenarios, you have to pass through the Juk gap squeezing between Greenland and Iceland or Iceland and the UK. For NATO, this corridor is a monitored kill zone. It's covered by underwater sensor networks, patrol aircraft, satellites, and decades of acoustic surveillance infrastructure. If you control Greenland, you control the western wall of that gate. If Greenland ever fell under hostile influence, say through heavy foreign investment in dual use ports or airfields, that gate becomes harder to secure. This is where the idea of the unsinkable aircraft carrier comes in. You can sink ships. You can disable carriers, but you cannot sync an island. Control of Greenland gives permanent forward basing for radar, aircraft, sensors, and early warning systems sitting directly between North America, Europe, and Russia. In military strategy, distance equals reaction time, and reaction time saves lives. A missile launched from Moscow travels roughly 5,000 mi to reach Washington, DC. From northern Greenland to Moscow, the distance is barely over 2,000 mi. Geography compresses warning time and amplifies leverage. That's why the [music] Juk gap is becoming active again. Russian submarines are quieter, more capable, and more persistent than at any point since the Cold War. Now, imagine if the United States actually owned Greenland. No diplomatic friction over expanding runways or deploying new sensor systems. No negotiation delays for missile tracking upgrades. It becomes sovereign territory, a permanently hardened forward defense zone in the Arctic. Here's where it gets complicated. Greenland today is a self-governing territory within Denmark with its own parliament and a growing independence movement. Its population is just over 56,000 people smaller than an NFL stadium. An independent Greenland would face serious financial pressure. And when small countries need infrastructure, they often look for outside investors. And one country specializes in writing very large infrastructure checks. China. We've seen this playbook before in Sri Lanka's port leases and in China's overseas base in Djibouti. Infrastructure financing becomes strategic leverage. US defense planners are deeply concerned about a future polar Silk Road scenario where China gains operational influence in Greenland not through purchase but through debt, ports, airports and logistics access. If that happens, the Guap becomes far harder to secure. So when Trump said buy it, the delivery was clumsy, but the geopolitical logic underneath was not crazy. [music] It was a blunt attempt to block long-term strategic encroachment in the Arctic. And China's interest isn't only about shipping lanes. It's about what's buried under the ice. Which brings us to the real prize. Three, the trillion dollar treasure chest buried under the ice. Okay, let's talk money. If you're wondering why a real estate mogul would want a frozen island, look no further than your smartphone [music] or your electric car or the guidance system inside a modern cruise missile. Greenland isn't just ice. It's a massive strategic materials vault. As the ice retreats, geological surveys have confirmed enormous deposits of rare earth elements, particularly at a site called Kavana in southern Greenland. It's considered one of the largest undeveloped rare earth deposits outside China. Rareears [music] is a misleading name. They aren't actually rare. They're just brutally difficult and environmentally toxic to separate and refine, but modern technology depends on them. High performance magnets, guidance systems, electric motors, radar, satellites, all of it runs on rare earths. Advanced weapons systems alone require hundreds of pounds of rare earth-based components per platform. Fighter jets, submarines, missile systems, none of them exist at scale without these materials. Here's the strategic nightmare for Washington. China controls roughly 80 fundev to 90% of the world's rare earth processing capacity. [music] Even when rare earths are mined elsewhere, they usually get shipped to China for refining. If Beijing ever restricted exports, large portions of Western manufacturing, including defense production, would feel the shock immediately. Greenland represents one of the few realistic paths to diversifying that supply chain over the long term. Company estimates suggest the cafel deposit alone contains well over a million metric tons of rare earth oxides including critical elements like neodymium and dprosium. But here's the uncomfortable part. While American politicians were joking about buying Greenland, a Chinese company, Shanghai [music] Resources, quietly acquired a major ownership stake in the company holding development, writes [music] to Kafan yelled, "That gives China meaningful influence over one of the most strategically important rare earth projects on the planet." So buying Greenland isn't just about expansion. It's about preventing the factory of the world from controlling the raw materials of the next industrial era. Washington isn't seeing ice. It's seeing a supply chain vulnerability written in Mandarin. Four, the real Area 51 is under the snow. If you think the US government treats Greenland like ordinary sovereign territory, let me tell you a ghost story about a place called Camp Century. In 1959, the US Army Corps of Engineers arrived in Greenland with smiles and shovels. [music] They told Denmark they were building a scientific research station under the ice, a harmless Arctic lab to study weather and ice dynamics. What they actually built was a small underground city carved into the glacier. It had living quarters, a hospital, a chapel, a movie theater, and roughly 200 personnel at peak capacity. It was powered by one of the first portable military nuclear reactors ever deployed. The public story was science. The real mission was Project Iceworm. The plan was extraordinary. The US military envisioned carving thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the ice sheet to hide hundreds of nuclear missiles. The missiles would be constantly relocated on underground rail systems, [music] making them nearly impossible for Soviet surveillance to track or destroy. It sounded like something straight out of a Bond movie. There was just one problem. Ice [music] moves. Engineers underestimated how aggressively the glacier would deform the tunnels. Walls warped. Ceilings shifted. Maintenance became overwhelming. Even the reactor infrastructure began to feel the pressure of the moving ice. By the mid 1960s, the Pentagon quietly admitted the concept was unworkable. Camp Sentry was abandoned in 1967. The reactor core was removed, but much of the site's waste was left behind. Tens of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, PCB contaminated materials, sewage, and low-level radioactive residue buried beneath layers of ice. At the time, planners assumed the ice would remain frozen indefinitely. That assumption is now in doubt. As Arctic temperatures rise, scientists warned that parts of Camp Sententry could eventually thaw, potentially releasing contaminated meltwater into surrounding ecosystems over the long term. Today, America's presence in Greenland is far less secret, but far more strategically central. The installation formerly known as Thula Air Base is now Puffic Space Base, the northernmost US military installation on Earth. It hosts a powerful early warning radar operated by the 12th Space Warning Squadron, scanning continuously for ballistic missile launches over the polar routes. It is a critical pillar of America's missile warning architecture. If access to this base were ever compromised, early warning coverage over the Arctic would be significantly weakened. Which is why from Washington's perspective, owning Greenland wouldn't just simplify diplomacy, it would permanently lock down one of the most strategically sensitive radar locations on the planet. Five, the Polar Silk Road and the climate paradox. Here's the darkest irony of the 21st century. Climate change is a catastrophe for the planet, but a potential gold mine for global commerce. For most of human history, the Arctic Ocean was a frozen wall. If you wanted to ship a container from Shanghai to Rotterdam, you had to take the long route through the South China Sea across the Indian Ocean and up through the Seers Canal. That journey typically takes around 30 to 40 days. But as Arctic ice retreats, new routes are opening. The most important is Russia's northern sea route hugging the Siberian coastline. In peak summer conditions, it can shave 10 to 15 days off Asia- Europe shipping, often cutting transit times by roughly 25 to 35%. Fuel savings alone translate into billions of dollars annually for global shipping companies. In the future, an even more direct path, the Transpolar Sea Route, cutting straight across the central Arctic Ocean, may become viable as ice continues thinning. That route isn't commercially reliable yet, but planners are already preparing for it. There's also the Northwest Passage threading through Canada's Arctic archipelago near Greenland's approaches, offering another seasonal shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific. Greenland sits adjacent to the gateways of these emerging sea lanes. Whoever builds the ports, refueling hubs, repair yards, and search and rescue infrastructure nearby effectively becomes the logistical toll booth of the future Arctic economy. China openly calls this vision the polar silk road. It sees Arctic shipping as a way to move goods into Europe faster and diversify away from vulnerable choke points like the Suez Canal. Russia already charges transit fees, escort costs, and navigation services along its Arctic [music] coastline. But here's the catch. None of this infrastructure really exists in Greenland today. [music] There are few deep water ports, limited emergency facilities, and minimal shipping services. Building it requires massive capital. If Denmark can't afford to build it and the US [music] doesn't step in, someone else will. And the country walking around the world with the biggest infrastructure checkbook happens to rhyme with VINA. Owning Greenland wouldn't give Washington legal control over international shipping lanes, but it would give enormous influence over the ports, logistics hubs, security footprint, and commercial flow that make those routes usable in the first place. So when you hear about melting glacias, don't just think about rising sea levels. Think about new shipping lanes, new ports, and a quiet race to decide who gets to collect the tolls on tomorrow's global trade highways. Six, the independence trap. How to buy a country without buying it. Now, let's get into the real 4D chess Washington is playing. While the media laughed at the idea of Trump literally buying Greenland, policymakers were focused on a much more subtle strategy. It's what I call the independence trap. Here's the reality on the ground. Greenland already has its own language, its own parliament, its own flag, and control over most domestic policy, but its passport still says Denmark, and foreign policy and defense decisions are made in Copenhagen, nearly 2,000 mi away. Polls consistently show that a strong majority of Greenlanders support independence in principle, often somewhere between 60 and 80%. The dream of full sovereignty is real, but there's a catch. Every year, Denmark sends Greenland a block grant of roughly $4 billion Danish croner, about $600 million USD. That single transfer covers more than half of Greenland's public budget and roughly a fifth of its entire GDP. That money pays for hospitals, schools, infrastructure, energy systems, and social services. Without it, the economy would contract sharply. Independence without replacement funding would mean immediate austerity and falling living standards. So, here's the brutal truth. Greenland cannot currently afford to be fully independent unless someone replaces Denmark's money. This is where the strategy shifts from buying land to buying influence. If Greenland eventually votes for independence, the Danish subsidy would phase out. [music] The new government would urgently need replacement funding to stabilize the economy. And suddenly, whoever steps in first with financing, investment, and security guarantees becomes the most important partner in the country. If the US were to say, "Congratulations on your independence," we'll help replace that funding, invest in infrastructure, and guarantee security, in exchange for expanded military access and preferential investment rights. Washington would effectively gain enormous strategic leverage for a relatively modest annual cost. We're already seeing the early groundwork. In 2020, the United States reopened a consulate in Nuke for the first time since the 1950s. Alongside it came a $12.1 million civilian aid package aimed at business development and infrastructure. Denmark publicly welcomed the move, but privately officials were clearly uneasy about Washington establishing a permanent foothold inside what had long been Copenhagen's strategic [music] backyard. It's the geopolitical equivalent of someone quietly saying, "You don't need your old partner anymore. We can take care of you." And the risk cuts both ways. If the US hesitates, China is ready with its own checkbook, often offering fast financing with far fewer political conditions attached. So, the real race isn't just to buy land. It's a race to become the preferred partner of a future independent. Greenland 7, the trillion dollar question. What is the Zillow estimate? Okay, let's indulge the fantasy for a moment. Let's say the diplomatic stars align. Denmark agrees to sell. Greenland agrees to be bought and Congress decides to cut the check. What's the price tag? How do you value $836,000 square miles of ice, rock, and [music] strategic dominance? When Truman offered $100 million in 1946, that's roughly $1.6 billion in today's money. That's insultingly low. That's less than what Facebook paid for Instagram. When the story broke in 2019, analysts actually tried to run the numbers. Financial Times writers modeled different valuation scenarios, factoring in mineral potential, strategic military value, and land comparisons, and some estimates pushed toward the trillion dollar range, roughly around $1 trillion depending on assumptions. But there's another way to think about it, the Alaska model. We bought Alaska for about $129 million in today's dollars, roughly 2 cents per acre. If you applied that logic to Greenland, the price would be comically low. But real estate is about comps, and the geopolitical market has heated up since 1867. A more realistic lens is to treat Greenland like a distress sovereign asset with massive upside. Using that logic, you could justify valuations anywhere from $200 billion to $500 billion. even before counting minerals. To put that in perspective, $500 billion is in the same ballpark as what the US spends annually just servicing its national debt. It's comparable to the cost of developing the F-35 program. It's less than the market cap of Tesla. For the price of one Elon Musk company, the United States could theoretically secure the Arctic for generations. But here's the catch that breaks the calculator. You're not just buying land, you're buying a society. When the US bought the Virgin Islands in 1917, we bought the land and the people. If Greenland became a US territory, it's roughly 57,000 residents would likely gain territorial status, and eventual citizenship rights. They'd be entitled to federal services, health care support, infrastructure upgrades, and social programs. And the infrastructure bill alone would be enormous. Greenland has no intercit. You literally cannot drive from one town to another. Everything moves by air or boat. Bringing that up to modern standards would cost trillions over decades. So, the purchase price is just the down payment. The renovation costs would dwarf it. Supporters argue the alternative is worse. What's the cost of losing Arctic dominance? What's the cost of China controlling North Atlantic access? What's the cost of losing the materials race that powers the 21st century? Suddenly, a trillion dollars doesn't sound insane. But before anyone starts printing money, there's one thing every spreadsheet forgets. The people. Because while Washington and Beijing play chess on maps, the people living on the board are facing a crisis money can't easily fix. And that's where this story stops being a political thriller and starts becoming a tragedy. Eight. The people on the ice. A tragedy in three acts. While Washington, Copenhagen, and Beijing play risk with the map, the people actually living on the ice are fighting a very different kind of war. And honestly, this is the part of the story that should make you uncomfortable. To understand why Greenland is vulnerable, you have to look at its wounds. Wound number one, the Little Danes experiment. In 1951, Denmark launched a social experiment that still haunts the country. They removed 22 Inuit children from their families. Some were orphans, many were not, and sent them to Denmark. The goal was to culturally modernize them, teach them Danish, erase their native language, and turn them into model citizens who would one day return and help reshape Greenland. It was social engineering disguised as education. When the children eventually returned, many no longer spoke their own language. They felt alien in their own communities. Several struggled with addiction, isolation, and early death. Entire family lines were fractured. In 2022, the Danish government formally apologized and offered compensation, but apologies don't erase generational trauma. The episode left a deep distrust of foreign powers promising to help. Wound number two, the silent epidemic. If you walk through nuke or smaller settlements, you'll often see posters that say, "The call is free. No one is alone." They're not advertising a phone plan. [music] They're advertising a suicide hotline. Greenland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world per capita, especially among young men. The combination of long winter darkness, historical trauma, isolation, rapid cultural change, and limited mental health infrastructure has created a quiet crisis that touches nearly every family. When politicians casually talk about buying Greenland, they aren't talking about empty land. They're talking about a population that is hurting, resilient, and deeply sensitive to being treated like a commodity. Wound number three, the vanishing dogs. For thousands of years, the Inuit hunter and the sled dog were inseparable. You couldn't survive the Arctic without dogs. Today, that bond is breaking. As sea ice forms later and melts earlier, traditional hunting seasons have collapsed in many regions. Without reliable hunting, feeding sled dogs becomes impossible. Imported dog food is prohibitively expensive in remote settlements. [music] Some hunters have been forced into heartbreaking decisions, euthanizing dogs they can no longer support. Over the past two decades, Greenland's sled dog population has declined by roughly 40 50%. It's a visceral symbol of a culture caught between two worlds. The old Arctic way of life fading and the promised new economy of shipping lanes and mineral wealth still not fully arriving. Nine. The 2026 escalation, the military option, and now we're here, January 2026. [music] If you thought this story was just about a goofy 2019 tweet, you haven't been paying attention. What started as diplomatic awkwardness has escalated into serious strategic brinkmanship. In early January 2026, the White House confirmed that President Donald Trump and his national security team are actively exploring a wide range of options for securing Greenland, from negotiated acquisition to expanded security agreements. In a press briefing, press secretary Carolyn Levit said that utilizing the US military is always an option, framing it as one of several tools available to the commander-in-chief. Reuters swn. That statement sent shock waves through capitals in Europe. Denmark, a fellow NATO member and longtime US ally, swiftly reaffirmed that Greenland is not for sale and that its sovereignty must be respected. Danish Prime Minister Meta Frederickson and other European leaders warned that any suggestion of using force to change the status of Greenland would undermine the very foundations of the postworld war II international order. AP News. It's worth being clear about what's actually happening. The US administration has not mobilized forces to invade Greenland and Copenhagen has not consented to any transfer of sovereignty. What has changed is the tone from a sideline idea to a national security priority cited by US officials in light of broader concerns about Arctic influence from Russia and China. Reuters. Some US lawmakers have tried to frame the rhetoric as pressure on Denmark to negotiate, not as a legitimate threat of invasion. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for example, has emphasized that the administration's goal remains a diplomatic resolution, though he has not ruled out force entirely. Dubdub.israelhyam.com. Meanwhile, political backlash has grown not just abroad, but at home. European allies, including France, Germany, and Canada, have publicly reiterated their support for Greenland sovereignty and warned that any coercive move by the US would strain NATO ties and set a dangerous precedent under international law. AP News, what this all means is that we are watching a dramatic geopolitical escalation, not a traditional armed conflict. Yet, the stakes are immense. strategic access to the Arctic, control of critical minerals and shipping routes, and the future of a territory that has been under Danish sovereignty for over three centuries. Wikipedia. Whether this evolves into open conflict or ever returns to diplomacy remains to be seen, but the tone, for the first time in decades, [music] is unmistakably serious. 10. Final thoughts. So, why does the US want to buy Greenland? It's not because the US need more ice. It's not because anyone wants to ruin a pristine landscape. It's because the map of the world is changing. For 500 years, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of the world. For the last 50 years, it was the Pacific. But the next 50 years, the future will be decided in the north. Greenland is the cork in the bottle. It holds the minerals for our technology, the radar for our defense, and the keys to the new oceans opening up at the top of the world. The US sees Greenland not as a country, but as a shield. China sees it as a battery. Denmark sees it as a responsibility. And the Greenlanders, they mostly just want stability, dignity, and a future their children can survive. The question isn't whether Greenland will become more valuable. The question is how the world handles that value. With diplomacy, with money, or eventually with force, the ice is melting. And as it the ice is disappears, it's revealing the most dangerous thing of all, greed. Thanks for watching.

8. Why Italy Can’t Grow (The Curse of The Lira)

Imagine it's 1987. You're sitting in a patza in Milan. The fashion is loud. The hair is big. And the economy, the economy is absolutely roaring. Everyone is making money. Italy is officially the fifth largest economy in the world, having just overtaken the United Kingdom. They call it Ils Paso. The vibe is electric. You order another espresso, pay with a fistful of lera that feels like monopoly money, and think to yourself, "This party is never going to end." Now, snap back to reality. It's 2025. That party didn't just end. The police came, raided the house, and burned it to the ground. Italy hasn't just slowed down. It has flatlined. It is the only developed economy that has barely grown in over two decades. While the US economy has roughly doubled since the turn of the millennium, Italy's GDP per capita is practically stuck in a time loop, hovering around the same levels it saw when The Matrix was in theaters. We're talking about a slow motion economic suicide. But here's the twisted part. The seeds of this disaster weren't planted by the euro or globalism or bad luck. They were planted during those golden years. Italy is suffering from a very specific, very fatal addiction, a ghost from the past called the LRA. Today, we're doing an autopsy on the sick man of Europe. We're going to look at the seven specific reasons why this beautiful country is economically doomed. Welcome to the Italian stagnation. Bun, the competitive devaluation drug or how to fake success. Let's start with the ghost in the room. You can't understand why Italy is failing today without understanding how it succeeded in the past. And I use the word succeeded with massive air quotes. You see, back in the 70s, 80s, and early '90s, Italy had a superpower. It wasn't efficiency. It wasn't high-tech innovation like Silicon Valley. It wasn't German engineering precision. It was a printing press. Here is how the Italian economic miracle actually worked for a long time. Let's say you owned a factory in Tin making washing machines. You're competing against a guy named Hans in Germany. Hans invests millions in robots to make his washing machines better and cheaper. You you don't want to buy robots. Robots are expensive. Robots require training. So you call up your friends in Rome. The government looks at the trade balance and says, "Don't worry, Luigi. We got you. The Bank of Italy would devalue the Lera. Overnight, your Lera is worth less compared to the German mark. This means your washing machines suddenly become 20% cheaper for Americans or French people to buy. Not because you made them better, but because your money is now garbage. This was the competitive devaluation strategy. It was Italy's favorite economic drug. For decades, this worked. It kept Italian exports flying off the shelves. It allowed small, inefficient family businesses to dominate global markets without ever really needing to modernize. Why invest in R&D when the central bank can just slash the currency's value and make you competitive again? But here is the dark side of that drug. When you devalue your currency to boost exports, you are essentially importing inflation. Things you buy from abroad like oil, gas, and raw materials get more expensive. So the cost of living goes up. To fix that, Italy had something called the Scala Mobile, the escalator. This wasn't a way to get to the second floor of a mall. It was a wage indexation system. If inflation went up, wages automatically went up. Sounds great, right? Wrong. It created a death spiral. Devaluation caused inflation. Inflation triggered the Scarlet Mobile to raise wages. Higher wages made businesses less profitable. So the businesses cried to the government who, you guessed it, devalued the currency again. By the early '90s, the LRA was a joke. In 1992, during a currency crisis, [music] thanks partly to our friend George Soros shorting the hell out of everything. The Lera collapsed so hard it was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism. Why does this matter today? [music] Because in 1999, Italy joined the Euro. Imagine taking a guy who has been addicted to painkillers for 40 years. [music] A guy who relies on those pills to get out of bed, to go to work, to function, and you flush his stash down the toilet. [music] Cold turkey, no rehab, just good luck, buddy. That is exactly what happened when Italy adopted the euro. They lost the ability to devalue. They lost the printing press. Suddenly those washing machine factories in Turin had to compete with Hans in Germany based on actual efficiency and actual quality. And guess what? They couldn't because they spent decades hooked on the easy fix. Italian industry never built the muscle mass needed for real competition. They were flabby and weak, hiding behind a cheap currency. When the eurolocked the exchange rate, the curtain fell. Italy was left naked on the European stage and the audience, the global market wasn't impressed. This is the curse of the Lera. It's the phantom limb pain of an entire economy reaching for a lever that isn't there anymore. [music] Two, the productivity flatline, the Peter Pan syndrome. So, the currency drug is gone. But surely Italian businesses adapted, right? Surely they looked at the new Euro landscape and said, "Okay, time to get serious. Time to digitize. It's time to scale up. Nope. This brings us to reason number two. And honestly, this is the one that keeps economists awake at night screaming into their pillows. It's the productivity flatline. Let me hit you with a stat that should terrify you. Since Italy joined the euro in 1999, its total factor productivity, which is a fancy economist way of saying how efficiently we use labor and capital, has been essentially zero. actually worse than zero. In some sectors, it has declined. While workers in Germany, France, and even Spain were becoming more productive every year, producing more widgets per hour, writing more code per day, Italy just stopped. Why? Welcome to the Peter Pan problem of Italian business. Italy is famous for itsmemes, small and medium enterprises. You know the vibe. the charming family-owned leather shop in Florence, the third generation ceramic maker in Sicily. It's romantic. It's artisal. It's what makes Italy Italy. But in the brutal world of modern global economics, it is a death sentence. In Italy, over 90% of businesses have fewer than 10 employees. These are microfirms. Here is the brutal truth about micro firms. They don't innovate. If you are a company of five people, usually the dad, CEO, the mom, accountant, the son, manager, and two cousins, you're not going to invest €5 million into an AIdriven logistics system. You aren't going to hire a high-priced consultant to streamline your supply chain. You aren't going to spend money on R&D. You're just trying to survive until August so you can go on vacation. This is the dwarfism of Italian capitalism. But why stay small? Is it just culture? Is it just that Italians love working with their cousins? No, it's rational behavior. The Italian state [music] actively punishes you for growing. Imagine you are an Italian business owner. You have 14 employees. Business is good. You want to hire a 15th person. Stop. In Italy, crossing the threshold of 15 employees is like walking into a minefield. Once you hit 15, a massive amount of labor protection laws kick in. it becomes nearly impossible to fire anyone. The union representation requirements explode. The bureaucracy triples. So what do you do? You don't hire the 15th person or you hire them off the books. We'll get to the shadow economy later. Or you split your company into two smaller companies of seven people each to stay under the radar. This keeps companies artificially small. And because they stay small, they stay inefficient. They can't achieve economies of scale. They can't export to China or the US effectively because they don't have the volume. And here is the kicker, management by blood. In the US or UK, if a family business [music] gets big enough, eventually the founder steps aside and hires a professional CEO, someone with an MBA who knows what they're doing. In Italy, as Lutime know, the business is passed from the father to the eldest son or daughter if she's lucky. Regardless of whether that kid is a genius or a total this dynastic management is rampant in Italy. Studies have shown that firms managed by the eldest son of the founder are statistically significantly worse performing than those managed by external professionals. So you have millions of tiny companies terrified of growing because of regulations run by the founders kids who got the job by birthright rather than merit, [music] unable to invest in technology because they have no capital. And we wonder why productivity hasn't moved since the '90s. While the rest of the world was building Amazon, Google, and Volkswagen, Italy was doubling down on Giovanni and Son's leather belts. And while Gavanni makes a damn good belt, he can't carry the GDP of a G7 nation on his back. Speaking of things that need to grow, this channel, we're diving deep into the dark underbelly of the global economy every week. If you want to know which country is going to collapse next, hit that subscribe button. It's free and unlike the Italian government, I promise not to waste your time. Also, drop a comment below. Have you ever worked for a family business where the boss's son was incompetent? Let me know your horror stories. I read them all. Now, back to the disaster. Three, the demographic death spiral or no country for young men. If the productivity problem is a chronic illness, this next point is terminal cancer. You cannot have economic growth without people. It's basic math. You need workers to make things and you need consumers to buy things. Italy is running out of both. Let's take a trip to the beautiful Italian countryside. You've probably seen those viral articles on Facebook or CNN. Buy a house in Sicily for €1. Sounds like a dream, right? You imagine yourself fixing up a rustic villa, drinking wine under an olive tree, living the lulchevita. But ask yourself, why is the house €1? It's not because the mayor is feeling generous. It's because the previous owner died, their children moved to London or Milan 20 years ago, and there is literally no one left in the village to buy it. These aren't real estate deals. They are desperate screams for help from dying communities. Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in the known universe. To keep a population stable, you need a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. That's [music] the replacement rate. Italy is currently sitting at about 1.2. They aren't just shrinking, they are evaporating. Last year, Italy recorded fewer births than at any time since the unification of the country in 1861. Think about that. Fewer babies were born in modern, wealthy, peaceful Italy than during World War I, when half the men were in trenches and the Spanish flu was ravaging the continent. This creates a terrifying economic shape called the inverted pyramid. In a healthy economy, you have a huge base of young workers supporting a small tip of retirees. In Italy, the pyramid is upside down. You have a massive, swelling, topheavy generation of retirees resting on the shoulders of a shrinking, crumbling base of young workers. This leads to the pension bomb. Italy spends nearly 17% of its entire GDP on pensions. That is the second highest in the OECD, right behind Greece. Every year, the government has to take a massive slice of the budget. money that could be used for high-spe speed internet, schools, green energy, or tax cuts and funnel it directly into pension checks. And the politics of this are toxic because the elderly make up the largest voting block. No politician dares to touch their pensions. It's political suicide. So you end up with policies like quot 100 introduced a few years ago which actually allowed people to retire earlier. In a country that is rapidly aging, the government paid people to stop working sooner. It makes zero economic sense, but it makes perfect political sense. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Taxes on the young are astronomical because they have to pay for the old because taxes are so high and salaries are so low. Remember the productivity flatline. Young couples can't afford to buy a house or have kids, so they don't have kids, which makes the demographic crisis worse, which raises taxes further. It is a snake eating its own tail. And the snake is slowly dying of old age. When you walk through the streets of provincial Italy, you don't feel the buzz of the future. You feel the heavy, comfortable weight of the past. It's a country that feels like a massive open air museum. And the problem with museums is that they don't produce anything. They just preserve what's already there. Four, the bureaucratic inferno. Kafka was an amateur. Now, let's say you're brave. You ignore the currency issues. You ignore the demographics. and you decide, I am going to start a business in Italy. I have a great idea. I have funding. Let's go. Welcome to hell. Actually, hell might be preferable because at least in hell, you know the rules. In Italy, you are entering the bureaucratic inferno. The World Bank does a ranking called doing business. For years, Italy has ranked terribly, often falling behind countries like Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and Azabaijan in terms of contract enforcement. Let me give you a specific painful example, the civil justice system. Let's say you are a supplier. You sell €100,000 worth of goods to a client. The client takes the goods, smiles, and decides not to pay you. In the UK or Germany, you take them to court. It takes a few months. The judge looks at the contract, bangs the gavl, and the sheriff goes to collect your money. In Italy, you better get comfortable. The average time to resolve a commercial dispute in Italy is over 1,000 days. That is nearly 3 years, and that's just the average. If the other guy has a good lawyer and knows how to play the appeal system, it can drag on for a decade. If you are a small business, you can't survive 3 years without that 100k. You go bankrupt waiting for justice. This creates a culture of non-compliance. Bad actors know the system is broken, so they abuse it. They know they don't have to pay their debts because by the time the court forces them to, you'll be out of business or dead. And it's not just the courts. It's the sheer weight of the red tape. Italy has a legendary addiction to laws. It is estimated that Italy has over 150,000 laws currently in force. For comparison, France has about 7,000. [music] Germany has about 5,000, 150,000 laws. It is a legal jungle so dense that not even the regulators know what is legal and what isn't. Let's look at the super bonus disaster. This was a recent scheme to jumpstart the economy by giving people tax credits to renovate their homes. Sounds good, right? But the regulations governing it changed literally over 30 times in 2 years. Architects, banks, and construction companies were paralyzed. One day the paperwork was blue, the next day it was red, the next day the program was cancelled, the next day it was back, but only for condos. This uncertainty is poison. Foreign investors look at this chaos and say, "No thanks. Why would Tesla or Google build a massive factory in Italy if it takes 5 years to get a permit and they can't fire anyone? And if a supplier rips them off, the courts won't help them. They wouldn't. They go to Poland. They go to Ireland. They go to Spain. Italy misses out on billions of euros in foreign direct investment FDI every year. Not because the country isn't attractive, but because the state is unworkable. The bureaucracy in Italy isn't just an annoyance. It's a tax on time. And in the modern economy, speed is everything. If you are slow, you are dead. Italy is currently moving at the speed of a sloth swimming through molasses. Five. The brain drain lfuga de travelli. So we have a stagnant economy, a dying population, and a nightmare government. If you're a smart, ambitious 25-year-old Italian with a master's degree in engineering or physics, what do you do? You leave. This is the brain drain, or as the Italians call it, lauga de cervelli, the flight of the brains. This is perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the Italian tragedy. Italy has a fantastic education system. Their high schools, Lyso Classico, Scientifico, provide a rigorous education. Their universities like the Polytenico de Milano or Bkonei produce worldclass engineers and economists. The Italian state spends hundreds of thousands of euros educating these kids. They pay for their healthare, their schooling, their subsidized university tuition. And then the moment these kids are ready to become productive taxpaying citizens. Italy hands them to Germany, the UK, [music] and the US for free. It is the worst trade deal in history. Italy is exporting diamonds, human capital, and importing sand. Why are they leaving? Let's look at the numbers. An entry-level engineer in Milan might make €400 a month. That same engineer hopping on a 2-hour Ryionaire flight to Munich or Dublin can make 3 to500 or €4,000 a month instantly. But it's not just about the money. It's about the gerontocracy ruled by the old. In Italian workplaces, meritocracy is often a dirty word. You don't get promoted because you are the best. You get promoted because you have seniority or because you know the right people. [music] It's a feudal system disguised as a corporate ladder. Young Italians are tired of waiting their turn. They are tired of being treated like interns until they are 40 years old. There is a grim joke among expats in London. What do you call an Italian with a PhD in physics? Answer: a barista in Soho. But the reality is that the physicist is probably working at a hedge fund in Canary Warf or a tech lab in Cambridge. And even if they were a barista, they might still have more disposable income and independence in London than living in their parents' basement in Rome at age 32. The statistics are damning. Over the last decade, nearly 1 million Italians have immigrated. And these aren't retirees looking for Florida sun. These are the young, the educated, [music] and the mobile. When the smartest people leave, innovation leaves with them. You lose the people who start startups. You lose the people who file patents. You lose the people who push for political change. You're left with a society that is less dynamic, more conservative, and less capable of solving its own problems. And the ones who stay, they are often trapped in the procariat, bouncing from short-term contract to short-term contract with no job security, unable to get a mortgage, unable to plan a future. This massive exodus acts as a safety valve for the government. If these angry unemployed young people stayed in Italy, there might be a revolution. There might be massive protests demanding change, but instead they just buy a one-way ticket to Berlin. The pressure is released and the status quo, the rot continues undisturbed. It is a tragedy of wasted potential. Italy is bleeding out its future, one boarding pass at a time. Six. The North South Divide, a tale of two Italies. If you look at a satellite map of Italy at night, you can see the problem glowing in the dark. [music] The north from Milan to Venice is a blaze of light. It's industrialized, connected, and wealthy. In fact, if northern Italy were its own country, it would be one of the richest nations in Europe, competing toe-to-toe with Bavaria or Switzerland. But scan your eyes down past Rome, past Naples, down into the Medzoro, the South. The lights get dimmer, the roads get worse, the economy vanishes. This is the question Maridional, the southern question. It is the oldest and most stubborn wound in Italian history and it is actively dragging the entire country underwater. The GDP per capita in the south is roughly half that of the north. We aren't talking about a slight regional difference like New York versus Alabama. We're talking about the difference between Germany and Tunisia existing inside the same borders using the same currency governed by the same parliament. So why is the South so broken? It's easy to blame the mafia, and believe me, we will. But it's deeper than that. It's infrastructure. For decades, Italy promised to build modern highways and high-speed rail to the south. But the projects either never started or they turned into the Salerno Rejo Calabria Highway, a construction project that became a national meme because it took over 50 years to finish. Imagine trying to run a modern logistics company from Calabria when your trucks are stuck on single lane roads that were paved when disco was popular. You can't. Then there is the mafia tax. In regions like Sicily, Calabria, and Campania, organized crime isn't just a movie trope. It's an economic parasite. It's called the pizza, protection money. Small businesses have to pay a percentage of their revenue to the local mob just to stay open. This acts like a massive invisible tax on the entire southern economy. It kills profitability. It scares away foreign investment. Who wants to open a factory in Naples if they have to negotiate with the Kamora to get their trucks out of the warehouse? But the real tragedy is the dependency. Because the private sector in the south is so weak, the state became the only employer in town. In some southern provinces, a staggering percentage of the workforce is employed by the public sector. forest rangers, municipal clerks, endless administrators. This creates a clientele system. You don't get a job because you're good. You get a job because you voted for the right politician who controls the hiring at the local post office. The North resents this deeply. The industrious factories of Lombodi feel like they are being taxed to death to subsidize what they see as a corrupt, inefficient South. This tension fuels political instability and movements like the Northern League, who used to advocate for literally cutting the South loose until Italy can figure out how to integrate the South, how to make it a productive engine rather than a welfare dependent. The national economy is running on one leg, and you can't win a race hopping on one leg. Seven, the debt trap, living on borrowed time. Now we arrive at the final boss, the number that hangs over Italy like the sword of Damocles. €2.9 trillion. That is Italy's national debt. It is roughly 140% of their GDP. It is a number so large the human brain can't really comprehend it. So let's visualize it. Imagine every single man, woman, and child in Italy. From the newborn baby in the hospital to the 100-year-old noner waking up this morning with a debt of roughly 48,000 strapped to their chest. This debt is the chain that binds everything else we've talked about. Remember when we said Italy needs to invest, needs to modernize schools, needs to fix the courts, needs to build digital infrastructure? They can't. They are broke. Every year, Italy pays roughly 80 to 90 billion just in interest on its debt. They aren't paying down the principle. They're just paying the rent on the money they already spent in the 80s and '90s. That 90 billion is dead money. It's money that isn't building hospitals. It isn't lowering taxes. It isn't funding startups. It [music] is just disappearing into the void of the bond market. And this makes Italy incredibly vulnerable. They are at the mercy of the spread. The spread is the difference between the interest rate on German bonds, the safe haven, and Italian bonds, the risky bet. When investors get scared, maybe because of a pandemic or a war in Ukraine or a stupid comment by an Italian politician, they sell Italian debt. The interest rate spikes. If that rate gets too high, the interest payments become impossible to afford. The country goes bankrupt. This happened in 2011. Italy was on the brink of default. The entire Euro zone was about to collapse. The European Central Bank had to step in with the famous whatever it takes speech to save them. But here is the terrifying reality. Italy is too big to fail, but it is also too big to save. Greece was small. The EU could bail out Greece. Italy is the third largest economy in the Euro zone. If Italy defaults, there is not enough money in the German Treasury to bail them out. It would be a financial apocalypse that would make 2008 look like a picnic. It would likely destroy the euro and shatter the European Union. So, Italy is trapped in a zombie state. They can't spend their way out of the crisis because of the debt. They can't grow their way out because of the productivity and demographic crisis. They are just drifting, refinancing their loans, praying that interest rates stay low and hoping that the next crisis doesn't push them over the edge. It is a highwire act with no safety [music] net performed by an acrobat who is getting older and slower every single day. Final thoughts. Is there any hope? So, is this it? Is Italy [music] destined to become a third world country with first class ruins? I know this video has been heavy. We've looked at the addiction to devaluation, the flatlined productivity, the demographic collapse, the bureaucratic nightmare, the brain drain, the north south divide, and the mountain of debt. It looks hopeless, but Italy has surprised the world before. This is a country that rose from the ashes of World War II to become an industrial powerhouse in barely 20 years. This is a country with immense reserves of private wealth. Italians are famously good savers, even if their state is broke. It is a global superpower in culture, luxury, tourism, [music] and lifestyle. The made in Italy brand is still one of the most valuable assets on the planet. But to survive the 21st century, Italy needs a revolution. Not a violent one, but a cultural one. They need to shatter the gerontocracy and let the young lead. They need to smash the bureaucracy and embrace digitization. [music] They need to stop protecting dying micro businesses and start encouraging global champions. They need to make the South a land of opportunity, not a land of subsidies. It is a tall order. It requires painful reforms that no politician wants to make because they will lose the next election. But the alternative is the slow, comfortable slide into irrelevance. The venicification of the entire peninsula, a beautiful sinking theme park for Chinese and American tourists, inhabited by tour guides and waiters, remembering a time when they used to build empires. The choice is Italy's, but the clock is ticking and the alarm has been ringing for 20 years. What do you think? Can Italy turn it around? Or is the curse of the Lera fatal? If you are Italian or if you love Italy, I want to hear from you in the comments. Tell me I'm wrong, tell me about the innovation you see on the ground, or tell me I'm right and share your story of leaving. And if you learned something from this autopsy of an economy, hit that like button. It helps the algorithm, which is the only thing growing faster than Italy's debt. Thank you for watching. I'll see you in the next video.
