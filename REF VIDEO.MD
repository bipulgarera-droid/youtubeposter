TRANSCRIPT OF THE REF VIDEO:

January 14th, 2026, 3:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time yesterday, the United States Mint website looked like a digital ghost town. If you tried to buy a silver eagle, the buy now button was just gone. Not grayed out, not out of stock, vanished. Same story for the Morgan dollar sets. The product pages were still there. The photos were still there, but the ability to actually exchange dollars for physical silver had been erased from the site like it never existed. No press conference, no official statement, just a leaked email to authorized distributors that I got forwarded around 6 p.m. last night citing market volatility as the reason for the suspension. That's it. That's all the transparency the sovereign mint of the world's reserve currency felt you deserved. Meanwhile, CNBC ran a segment this morning calling it a temporary technical suspension. Bloomberg's headline read, "Mint pauses sales amid price spike. Precautionary move." They're framing this like it's a responsible riskmanagement decision. Like the mint is just being careful because silver went up too fast. Here's what I need you to understand right now. The screen is lying to you. The US mint didn't stop selling because the price is too high. They stopped because the silver is gone. They can't source the metal. And as of this afternoon, the contagion is already spreading to the private mints. But the US mint is just the first domino. London is already wobbling. I'm a private commodities analyst. I've been stacking physical silver for 12 years, and I built this channel because I was tired of waiting half a day for the mainstream media to report what I could already see happening in the vault data and the futures chains. You're not here for entertainment. You're here because you want the intel before it becomes consensus and frankly before it's too late to act on it. So, let me tell you exactly what we're watching unfold in real time. We are witnessing a physical force majour event, the institutional mechanism that has been used to suppress silver prices for decades. The paper shorts, the fractional reserve bullion banking system, the futures market magic has finally hit the wall of physical reality. When the sovereign mint of the world's reserve currency stops selling its own coin, the paper price becomes a work of fiction. There's a hierarchy to a supply squeeze, and we need to understand it. At the top, you have sovereign mints. They set the psychological anchor. When they're selling silver eagles at spot plus $6, that tells the market everything is fine. There's plenty of metal. When they stop selling entirely, that anchor gets ripped off the ocean floor. Suddenly, the paper price, the number you see on your screen, the spot price that every news channel quotes, that number becomes a suggestion. A plight fiction that has no connection to the price you'll actually pay if you try to walk into a dealer and buy 100 ounces. In this video, I'm going to pull back the curtain on backwardation. I'm going to run the math on the 300 million ounce deficit that everyone in the industry is whispering about, but no one wants to say out loud. And I'm going to show you exactly why the $90 spot price you're seeing right now is the biggest lie in finance. By the end of this, you'll understand what's happening at the comics, what's about to happen in London, and what I'm personally doing with my own capital as the exits start getting welded shut. Because here's the reality. This situation is moving faster than the news cycle. And if you wait for Jim Kramer to tell you there's a squeeze, you'll be 3 weeks too late and staring at a 40% premium on rounds that you can't even get delivered for 2 months. Let's get into it. As of 1:45 p.m. Eastern today, silver spot was trading at $90.38. Gold was at $4,63921. I want you to stop and look at the chart from this morning. You're going to see a long upper wick that kissed 9223 before getting hammered back down to 9038 by the afternoon. This isn't natural price discovery. This is a battle zone. Silver fought to stay above $92 this morning. It wanted to run. And then right around midm morning New York time, it got hit with what looks like coordinated selling pressure that dragged it back below the psychological $90 floor. I've watched this pattern for over a decade. This is what it looks like when bullion banks are desperately defending a price level because they know what's on the other side of it. Here's the divergence that should terrify you. While spot says $90.38, I'm hearing from authorized purchasers that premiums have gone parabolic. We're talking 1.5 times spot for generic rounds, if you can even find them. Do the math. That's a real physical price closer to $135 an ounce. The price on your screen is a suggestion. The price at the counter is a hostage negotiation. And that spread, that gap between the paper price and the physical price, that's the smoking gun. That's the market screaming that something is fundamentally broken. Now, let me teach you the key mechanism that explains why this is happening. It's called backwardation. And if you understand this concept, you'll understand why the US mint suspension isn't a glitch. It's a symptom of a market structure that's collapsing in real time. Backquidation is a rare market state where the price for immediate delivery is higher than the price for delivery in the future. Let's pull this apart because this is critical. In a healthy functioning commodity market, the future is always more expensive than the present. If you go to buy crude oil, the price for a barrel delivered in six months is going to be higher than the price for a barrel delivered today. Why? Because storing that barrel costs money. Warehousing costs money. Insurance costs money. And there's an opportunity cost to capital. The money tied up in that oil could be earning interest somewhere else. This normal state is called contango. Future more expensive than spot. That's the default. When the market flips into backwardation, it means the future is cheaper than the present. Think about what that's telling you. It means the market is screaming for metal now. It means people are willing to pay a premium to get their hands on physical silver today rather than waiting for a futures contract to settle in 3 months. It's a desperation signal. Let me give you an analogy. Imagine you walk into a car dealership and the lot is completely empty. The dealer tells you, "Hey, I can get you an SUV in 6 months for $50,000, but there's a guy in the parking lot who wants $80,000 for the SUV he's driving right now because there are no other cars left on the lot. you're paying a 60% premium for immediate possession because waiting isn't an option. That's backwardation. Now, here's the trap, and this is where it connects to the US Mint. The mint can't source physical silver at the paper price to meet immediate demand. They're caught in the backwardation vice. The futures market says silver is $90. But when they go to their suppliers and say, "We need 500,000 ounces delivered next week." The suppliers are saying, "Sure, but it's going to cost you 120 an ounce because everyone else is trying to get metal right now, too." The mint can't eat that margin. They can't sell you a silver eagle for $45 when it costs them 120 to source the plonche. So, they shut down sales entirely. They pull the product off the website and hope the market calms down. Except the market isn't calming down. It's accelerating. If you think the US Mint is the only institution running dry, wait until you see the ComX delivery logs, let's talk about the math because the numbers here don't add up. And when numbers don't add up in a fractional reserve system, that's when things break. I was looking at the comics data this morning and here's what jumped out. 36.06 million ounces, that's 7,212 contracts are standing for delivery in January alone. Just in January. On Tuesday, 1.03 03 million ounces were moved out of the registered vaults in a single day. That's not normal. That's not even high normal. That's a bank run in slow motion. Now, zoom out. According to the UBS and Scottsdale reports that have been circulating in the industry, we're looking at a global deficit of 300 million ounces for 2026. That's the gap between what the world is demanding, industrial use, investment demand, jewelry, and what the world is actually producing from the mines and recycling. 300 million ounces short. Let me put that in perspective. Total global silver production is around 850 million ounces a year. We're short by more than a third of annual production. That gap has to get filled somehow. And the way it's been getting filled for years is by draining the vaults. The comics vaults, the LBMA vaults in London, the ETF inventories. Those vaults have been acting as the buffer, the release valve that kept the price from exploding every time demand spiked. But here's the problem. Those vaults are finite. And if you keep draining them at 36 million ounces a month, you hit zero a lot faster than people think. Now layer in the China factor. On January 1st, 2026, China implemented new export licensing requirements for refined silver. If you want to get silver out of China, the world's primary refining hub, you now need government approval. They've effectively turned off the tap to the West. It's not a total embargo, but it's a massive friction point that's choking off supply right when the West needs it most. So, let's run the stress test. If comics deliveries continue at this pace, let's be conservative and say 30 million ounces a month, the registered vaults, the vaults that are actually available for delivery could hit operational zero within weeks, not months, weeks. I want to be very clear about what operational zero means. It doesn't mean the vaults are literally empty. It means the vaults have dropped below the threshold where the market has confidence that deliveries can be made in an orderly fashion. Once you cross that line, you get a stampede. Everyone who was waiting patiently for their futures contract to settle suddenly wants out now and the whole system locks up. The math says the system is insolvent. The skeptics say we're dreaming. Let's see who's right. Uh we're about 60% of the way through this. So let me give you a checkpoint recap because I want to steal them in the other side before we go further. Here's what we know so far. The US mint has stopped sales. Backwardation has set in. The physical premium overspot is screaming that people want metal now, not later. 36 million ounces are being yanked off the comics in January alone. The vaults are draining. But there is a counterargument, and I need to address it because if I don't, you're going to hear it somewhere else and wonder if I'm just cherry-picking data. The skeptic argument is demand destruction. The idea is that at $90 an ounce, industrial users are going to stop using silver. Solar panel manufacturers are going to substitute in cheaper materials. Electronics companies are going to redesign their products to use less silver or find alternatives. And on the supply side, at $90, every grandmother in America is going to start melting down the family silverware and flooding the market with scrap, which will crash the price back down to $60. It's a seductive argument because it's happened before in other commodities. When oil hit $140 a barrel in 2008, demand collapsed. People stopped driving as much. Airlines went bankrupt. The price crashed. So, let me tell you why that argument doesn't hold water here. First, industrial substitution in silver takes years, not days. If you're a solar panel manufacturer and your entire production line is built around silver paste for the conductive layer, you can't just flip a switch and start using copper coated alternatives. You have to re-engineer the product. You have to retool the factory. You have to run new quality tests and get new certifications. That process takes 18 months minimum, and that's if you start today. The price spike we're seeing right now isn't going to trigger that substitution fast enough to matter. Second, scrap supply. Yes, at $90 an ounce, you're going to see more scrap come to market. People are going to dig through their attics and sell off the silver candlesticks. But here's the thing about scrap. You can only sell it once. You can't melt down the family silver twice. Scrap is a one-time injection of supply and it gets absorbed by the market in a matter of weeks. It doesn't solve a 300 million ounce structural deficit. And here's the part that the skeptics always miss. $90 an ounce is not too expensive in any historical context. If you adjust the 1980 silver peak for inflation, silver would need to be over $200 an ounce just to match that high. We're not even halfway there. The idea that $90 is some kind of nosebleleed level that's going to trigger a collapse is a psychological anchor that does not have any basis in the actual supply demand fundamentals. The skeptics are betting on a slow bleed. They're betting that the market will calm down, that premiums will compress, that the mint will resume sales in a few weeks, and everyone will forget this ever happened. The data is suggesting something very different. The data is suggesting a vertical explosion. So, what happens next? Let me walk you through the institutional reaction and the key indicators I'm watching over the next 48 to 72 hours. First, expect the CME, the Chicago Merkantile Exchange, which runs the ComX, to hike margin requirements by 25% or more this week. This is their standard playbook. When volatility spikes, they raise the margin requirement, which means if you're holding a long futures position, you suddenly need to post more cash as collateral. This forces weak hands out of their positions. It's a way to cool down the market and reduce the number of contracts standing for delivery. I've seen this movie before. In 2011, when silver ran to $48, the CME hiked margins five times in two weeks. It worked. The price got cut in half. So, if you see margin hikes announced, don't panic. It's part of the game. They're trying to shake the tree and get you to drop your silver. Second, watch for a media blackout on the LBMA London situation. I've been hearing whispers for the last week about potential issues with unallocated silver in the London vaults. Unallocated means you own a claim on silver, but there's no specific bar with your name on it sitting in a vault. It's fractional reserve bullion banking. And if the rumors are true, the LBMA might be getting close to a point where they can't honor physical delivery requests on unallocated accounts. If that happens, if London switches to cash settlement only, that's the decoupling event. That's when the paper market and the physical market officially split into two different universes. Here's my dashboard. These are the three things I'm watching obsessively. Number one, LBMA vault data. The London Bullion Market Association publishes vault inventory numbers. If unallocated silver holdings drop another 10% from current levels, that's the canary in the coal mine, it means the fractional reserve ratio is breaking down and they are scrambling to source physical metal to back up the paper claims. Number two, the gold to silver ratio. Right now it's sitting at about 51 to1. That means it takes 51 ounces of silver to buy 1 ounce of gold. Historically, when silver squeezes, that ratio compresses fast. I'm watching for a move toward 40 to1 or lower. If we hit 40 to1, it means silver is outperforming gold on a relative basis, which is what happens when there's a physical shortage. Number three, the premium spread. I'm tracking the difference between spot and the actual dealer price for physical silver. Right now, we're at about 1.5 times spot for generic rounds. If that spread widens to two times spot or higher, it means the physical market has completely given up on the paper price as a reference point. If London switches to cash settlement only, here's what that looks like in practice. You call up your broker and say, "I want to take delivery of my 10,000 ounces of silver." And they say, "Sorry, we can't do that, but we'll pay you the cash equivalent at the current spot price." Except the spot price is $90 and the actual physical market is trading at 130. You just got robbed of $40 an ounce, and it's perfectly legal because you signed a contract that allowed for cash settlement in the event of force majour. That's the nightmare scenario for anyone holding paper silver. ETFs, unallocated accounts, futures contracts that you don't roll into physical delivery. All of it becomes monopoly money the second the LBMA or the comics says, "We're out. Here's your cash. Good luck finding real metal." And here's the kicker. When the paper price crashes, because everyone realizes it's worthless, but you still can't buy a physical coin for less than $100 an ounce. That's when you'll know the game is over. That's when the market has openly admitted that the emperor has no clothes, that the vaults were always running on fumes, and that the price suppression scheme has finally run out of road. So, let me tell you exactly what I'm doing with my own capital. I need to say this upfront. I am not a financial adviser. I'm not your financial adviser. I'm a guy who's been watching these markets for 12 years, and I'm watching the vaults empty in real time. What I'm about to share is my personal battle plan, and you need to do your own research and make your own decisions. Here are my indicators and my conditional strategies. First, I'm watching the 9150 level like a hawk. If silver holds above $91.50 for three consecutive daily closes, I'm interpreting that as breakout confirmation. At that point, the technical picture flips from fragile rally to sustained move higher. In that scenario, I'm looking to add exposure, but not through physical. Physical premiums right now are too predatory. I'm not paying a 50% premium when I can get leveraged exposure through the miners. Specifically, I'm looking at SILJ, the Junior Silver Miners ETF. When physical silver is in backwardation and the miners are still trading at reasonable valuations, that's where the asymmetry is. The miners give you operational leverage to the silver price without the premium gouging and the two-month delivery wait times. But here's the critical qualifier. I'm only adding to minor if we get confirmation. If silver fails at 9150 and rolls over, I'm sitting on my hands. I've been in this market long enough to know that failed breakouts are traps and I'm not interested in catching a falling knife. Second scenario, the US Mint resumeums sales, but the price tag is $120 or higher per silver eagle. If that happens, I'm interpreting that as the new permanent floor. It means the mint has openly admitted that the old pricing model is dead, that the spot price is irrelevant, and that the physical market is now setting the price based on actual supply and demand. In that scenario, I'm not selling a single ounce of my physical stack. In fact, I'm holding tighter because if the sovereign mint is pricing at 120, that tells me the private market is going to be even higher. It means we're in a regime where physical silver becomes a strategic asset, not just a speculation. Third scenario, the CME raises margins drastically. Let's say they double the margin requirement overnight. Here's what I'm doing in that scenario. Absolutely nothing. I'm sitting on my hands. I've seen this playbook in 2011. They raise margins to force liquidation. The price drops 20 to 30% in a week. As leverage longs get margin called out of their positions and then once the weak hands are flushed out, the price resumes its climb. If we get that margin induced sell-off, I'm treating it as a gift. I'm waiting for the panic bottom and then I'm buying more probably through the miners again because the margin hikes don't affect equity positions, only futures positions. So while the futures traders are getting slaughtered, I can step in and pick up miners at a discount. The thing about margin hikes is that they create artificial selling pressure. It's not real supply coming to market. It's not mines producing more silver. It's not scrap flooding in from the secondary market. It's just forced liquidation from traders who can't meet the new collateral requirements. That kind of selling gets absorbed quickly. And when the dust settles, the underlying supply demand picture hasn't changed at all. The deficit is still 300 million ounces. The vaults are still draining. The mint is still dark. So, if I see silver drop from 92 to 70 on a margin hike, I'm not panicking. I'm getting aggressive. That's the moment when everyone else is running for the exits and I'm walking in through the back door. Fourth scenario, and this is the big one. The LBMA confirms a physical delivery freeze. If London officially announces that they can't honor physical deliveries on unallocated accounts and they're switching to cash settlement, I'm moving entirely to self-custody and ignoring the ticker tape. Here's what that means in practice. I'm pulling everything out of ETFs, out of allocated storage programs, out of anything that has a custodian or a middleman. I'm taking possession. I'm treating silver like a crisis hedge, not a trading vehicle. Because at that point, the paper market is officially dead. And the only thing that matters is what you can hold in your hand or lock in a safe. And I'm ignoring the price. If the spot price says $70 because the paper market collapsed, but I can't actually buy a coin for less than 150, then the spot price is meaningless. It's a distraction. The only price that matters is the price I'd have to pay to replace my stack. And if I can't replace it at any price because there's no supply, then my stack just became priceless. Let me tell you why the LBMA situation is the keystone here. London is the nerve center of the global precious metals market. More gold and silver trades through London than anywhere else on Earth. The LBMA vaults are the backs stop for the entire Western Bullion banking system. When a bank in New York wants to hedge a position, when a pension fund in Germany wants exposure to precious metals, when a refiner in Switzerland needs to balance their books, it all flows through London. If London breaks, the entire architecture collapses. Because once the LBMA admits they can't deliver physical metal, every other institution in the chain starts asking the hard questions. If London can't deliver, can the comics? If the comics can't deliver, can the ETFs? If the ETFs can't deliver, what exactly am I holding? That's the cascade. That's the moment when confidence evaporates and everyone rushes for the exits at the same time. And in a fractional reserve system, there aren't enough exits. Most people are going to get stuck inside when they lock the doors. Now, let me talk about the psychological trap that I see retail investors falling into right now because I want to make sure you don't get caught in it. The trap is waiting for the mainstream media to confirm the squeeze before you act. The trap is thinking, "Well, if this is really as big as he's saying, CNBC will cover it and then I'll buy." That's backward. By the time CNBC is running a special segment on the silver squeeze, the premiums will be three times spot and you won't be able to get delivery for six months. The reason I built this channel is because the mainstream financial media is structurally designed to be late. They're not trying to give you actionable intel. They're trying to explain what already happened. I saw the Mint website go dark yesterday afternoon. I got the leaked distributor email last night. I checked the comics delivery data this morning. I'm telling you about it now a few hours later. If you wait for Bloomberg to write a long- form article about it next week, you've already missed the move. The other trap is paralysis. The trap of thinking, well, the situation is so complex when there are so many variables, so I'm just going to wait and see what happens. I understand that instinct. I really do. The problem is that in a squeeze, waiting and seeing is the same thing as getting priced out. If you're on the fence about building a position in physical silver or the miners and you decide to wait another month to see how it plays out, you might come back in a month and find that the price is 40% higher and the premiums have doubled. I'm not telling you to go all in today. I'm not telling you to back up the truck and buy a,000 ounces at a 50% premium. What I'm telling you is to have a plan. Know your entry points. Know your risk tolerance. Know what indicators you're watching. And when those indicators trigger, act decisively. For me, the indicator is 9150 for three consecutive closes. If we get that, I'm adding to minors. If we don't, I'm waiting. But I've already made the decision in advance. So, when the moment comes, I'm not sitting there paralyzed trying to figure out what to do. Let me give you one more conditional scenario because I think this one is underpriced by the market right now. If, and this is a big if, if we see a coordinated announcement from multiple sovereign mints in the next week, not just the US Mint, but also the Royal Canadian Mint, the Perth Mint in Australia, maybe the Austrian Mint, if they all suspend sales, citing supply issues, that's a five alarm fire. That's the market openly admitting that the entire Western minting infrastructure can't source metal. In that scenario, I'm immediately moving 20% of my liquid net worth into physical silver and miners, regardless of premium. Because at that point, it's not about getting a good entry price. It's about getting in at all. It's about positioning before the market realizes that this isn't a temporary blip. It's a structural break. And here's the thing. I don't think that scenario is unlikely. I think it's probable. The US Mint doesn't operate in a vacuum. They're all sourcing from the same global supply chain. If the US mint can't get planes, the Canadian Mint is facing the same problem. It's only a matter of time before they all go dark. The Perth Mint specifically is worth watching because they've had credibility issues before. Back in 2021, there were reports that they were running low on allocated silver and delaying deliveries. They denied it publicly, but the wait times told the real story. If Perth goes dark again, that's confirmation that the problem is global, not just a US supply chain issue. Now, let me address something I know some of you are thinking. You're thinking, "Okay, but what if this is all a false alarm? What if the mint resumes sales next week and the price drops back to $70 and you look like an idiot?" Fair question. Let me tell you how I'm managing that risk. First, I'm not leveraged. Everything I'm talking about here is cash positions. I'm not buying silver on margin. I'm not selling naked puts. I'm not doing anything that could blow up my account if I'm wrong. If I'm wrong and the price drops, I lose on paper, but I don't get margin called. I don't get liquidated and I can wait it out. Second, I'm not making this a binary bet. I'm not going 100% into silver and ignoring everything else. I still have exposure to equities, to real estate, to cash. Silver is a piece of the puzzle, not the whole puzzle. So, if I'm wrong, it doesn't wipe me out. Third, I have a time horizon. I'm not trying to trade this week to week. I'm positioning for a multimonth or even multi-year move. If the price chops around for the next three months before it eventually breaks out, I'm fine with that. I'm not expecting this to resolve in 72 hours. I'm expecting this to be a process. But here's what I keep coming back to the asymmetry. If I'm wrong, I lose maybe 20 or 30% on my silver positions before I cut them. If I'm right, we're talking about a 200 to 300% move over the next year. The riskreward is heavily skewed in favor of being positioned, even if there's a decent chance I'm early or partially wrong. And let me be honest about something else. I've been early before. In 2019, I started accumulating silver at $16 an ounce because I saw the industrial deficit building and the monetary policy tailwinds aligning. For 18 months, I watched my positions go sideways and then down as the price dropped to $14 in early 2020. I looked like an idiot and then COVID hit. The fiscal floodgates opened and silver went from $14 to $30 in 4 months. Being early feels the same as being wrong until it doesn't. The difference is that if you have conviction based on fundamentals and you're managing your risk properly, you can afford to be early. You can't afford to be late. Let me also talk about the endgame because I think it's important to have a mental model of where this goes if the squeeze thesis plays out. Endgame scenario one, the paper market capitulates. The comics and the LBMA both switch to cash settlement. The futures price crashes to $60 or $70 because nobody trusts paper anymore. But the physical market decouples entirely and trades at $150 to $200 based on actual supply and demand. In that scenario, if you're holding physical, you're fine. You ignore the paper price. You wait for the physical market to stabilize. If you're holding ETFs or futures, you get destroyed. This is the nightmare scenario for the bullion banks, by the way, because they've been running this fractional reserve game for so long that they have forgotten what happens when people call their bluff. They've built an entire derivatives tower on the assumption that 99% of futures contracts will get rolled or cash settled and nobody will ever actually ask for the metal. When that assumption breaks, when people start standing for delivery on mass, the whole structure comes down. Endgame scenario two, the short squeeze. The bullion banks who have been shorting silver for decades get caught in a delivery squeeze. They can't source the metal to cover their positions. They're forced to buy back their shorts at whatever price they can get. The price goes vertical. We're talking a move from $90 to $200 in a matter of weeks. In that scenario, the miners go absolutely parabolic, and anyone positioned in the space makes generational wealth. I've seen glimpses of this before. In 2011, silver went from $30 to $48 in less than a month. It was not a squeeze. It was a momentum rally, but it showed you what this market can do when it gets moving. A real squeeze, where the shorts are trapped and have no choice but to cover, would make that 2011 move look tame. Endgame scenario three, the slow grind. The mint resumes sales at elevated prices. The LBMA muddles through. The price chops between 80 and 110 for the next 6 months while the market slowly realizes that the deficit is real and the vaults aren't being refilled. In that scenario, it's not a dramatic explosion. It's a grinding bull market that takes a year to play out. Still profitable if you're positioned, just less exciting. This is actually the most likely scenario in my view. Markets don't usually resolve themselves overnight. What you get instead is a series of mini crises that slowly shift the consensus. The mint stays dark for 3 weeks. Then they come back, but with rationing, two coins per customer, elevated prices, long wait times. Then Perth announces delays. Then the LBMA quietly raises their allocated storage fees. Each event by itself is explainable, but when you string them together, the pattern becomes undeniable. I don't know which endgame we're heading toward. I suspect it's some combination of two and three where we get a short squeeze spike followed by a consolidation and then a grinding move higher. But the key point is that in all three scenarios, being positioned in physical or miners is the right trade. The only losing scenario is staying in paper and getting cash settled out of your position. Here's another thing I'm watching that doesn't get enough attention. Industrial users. Companies like First Solar, SunPower, all the solar panel manufacturers who use massive amounts of silver for their photovoltaic cells. These companies hedge their silver exposure months or even years in advance through futures contracts. But if the futures market breaks, if the comics can't deliver, these companies are going to have to go into the spot market and compete for physical metal. When that happens, you're going to see industrial users bidding against investment demand. And that's when the price really takes off. Because an investor can choose to sit on the sidelines if the price gets too high. But a solar panel manufacturer who has a billion dollar backlog of orders in a factory sitting idle because they can't get silver, they'll pay whatever it takes. That's the demand inelasticity that the market is underestimating. Industrial silver demand doesn't disappear at $90 or $120. It adjusts slowly over years. As companies redesign products, in the short term, they have no choice but to pay up. Let me also address the geopolitical angle here because it ties directly into the China export restrictions I mentioned earlier. China controls about 40% of global silver refining capacity. They're not a major producer. Most of the ore comes from Mexico, Peru, and Chile, but the ore has to be refined and most of it gets refined in China. On January 1st, they put in place new licensing requirements that effectively give the Chinese government veto power over any silver exports. Why would they do that? Because they're watching the same data we are. They see the deficit. They see the ComX draining. They see the West scrambling for metal. And they have decided they'd rather keep the silver inside China for their own industrial base and their own strategic reserves than let it flow west to prop up the ComX and the LBMA. This is economic warfare playing out in slow motion. It's not dramatic. There's no missiles, no sanctions. It's just a licensing requirement. But the effect is the same. Choking off supply to your competitors at the exact moment they need it most. And here's the kicker. There's no quick fix. You can't just build a new refinery in Ohio and start processing ore next month. Refining infrastructure takes years to build and requires environmental permits, skilled labor, and capital investment. In the short term, the West is dependent on China for refined silver, and China knows it. So, when I'm positioning for this squeeze, I'm not just thinking about the immediate supply demand dynamics. I'm thinking about the geopolitical chess game that's playing out in the background. If China decides to tighten the screws even further, maybe they announce an outright export ban on refined silver, the price could gap up 50% overnight, that's tail risk that's not priced into the current market. All right, let's bring this home. Here's the recap. The US Mint has suspended all silver sales. The buy now buttons are gone. The official explanation is market volatility. The real explanation is they can't source the metal at a price that makes sense. ComX is facing a 36 million ounce delivery wave in January alone. The vaults are draining. We're looking at a 300 million ounce global deficit for the year. Backwardation has set in, which means the market is screaming for immediate delivery in the normal market structure has inverted. China has turned off the export tap with new licensing requirements. The LBMA in London is rumored to be in trouble with unallocated accounts. The physical premium over spot has blown out to 50% or more if you can even find metal. The paper price says $90. The physical market says 135. That spread is the crack in the dam. Here's my final rallying cry, and I want you to really hear this. The paper wall is cracking. For decades, they told us there was plenty of silver. They told us the vaults were full. They told us that the price was set by supply and demand in a free market. Yesterday, the US Mint admitted they were wrong. They didn't say it explicitly, but the dark website said it for them. The metal is gone. Don't wait for the mainstream media to tell you the squeeze is here. It's already through the front door. It's already in the comics vaults. It's already showing up in the premiums at your local coin shop. Within the next 48 hours, we're going to see if the LBMA follows suit. We're going to see if London confirms what everyone in the physical market already knows. The fractional reserve bullion system is out of metal. If you've been sitting on the fence, now is the time to make a decision. Not tomorrow, not next week, now. Because the situation is moving faster than the news cycle. And by the time the headlines catch up, the opportunity will be gone. I'm watching 91150. I'm watching the LBMA vault data. I'm watching the premium spreads. I'm watching the miners for value. And when my indicators trigger, I'm acting. I've already made my plan. I know what I'm buying. I know at what price. And I know what my exit looks like if I'm wrong. You need to have that same level of clarity. Because in a squeeze, hesitation is the same thing as capitulation. This isn't financial advice. This is a guy who's been in the trenches for 12 years telling you what he sees and what he is doing about it. Take it or leave it, but don't say you weren't warned. One last thing, I know some of you are going to watch this video and do nothing. You're going to think about it. You're going to agree with the thesis. And then you're going to get distracted by life and forget about it. And then in 3 months, you're going to see silver at $160. And you're going to kick yourself for not acting when you had the chance. Don't be that person. If you believe the thesis, position accordingly. Even if it's just a small position, even if it's just 10% of your portfolio, do something. Because the regret of missing an opportunity is worse than the regret of taking a small loss. The deep research on the London situation is already up on the channel. Go watch it. Understand what happens if the LBMA breaks tonight and then make your plan. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one.

Yesterday afternoon, the United States Mint quietly erased the “buy now” button from its website. Not ‘out of stock.’ Not ‘coming soon.’ Vanished. One moment you could buy a Silver Eagle, the next, the option was gone.

This morning, the official narrative is calling it a “temporary technical suspension”—a responsible pause amid market volatility. They want you to believe this is just prudent risk management. They are lying to you.

For twelve years, I've tracked the physical inventory that's supposed to back the paper price. This isn't a technical glitch. It’s a distress signal. The U.S. Mint didn't stop selling silver because the price is too high. They stopped selling because they can no longer get it. This is the first domino. And if you think this is just an American problem, you haven't seen the delivery reports coming out of London.

This isn't just a headline for Wall Street traders. This is a direct threat to the dollars in your bank account, to the value of your retirement fund, to your family’s financial future.

The number you see on the screen—that $90 spot price—is quickly becoming a fantasy. Right now, the real, in-your-hand price for physical silver is soaring past $135 an ounce. That’s a 50% gap between the official price and reality. Think about that. For every two ounces of silver your money is supposed to be worth, you can only actually buy one.

This isn't a "premium." This is a wealth seizure happening in plain sight.

Your ability to convert paper promises into a real, tangible asset is evaporating. The U.S. Mint just turned off the spigot. Private dealers are being picked clean. This isn’t a temporary glitch; it’s a structural failure. The system that is supposed to guarantee your access to real money is breaking, right now, in real time.

So how did the paper price of silver become the biggest lie in modern finance?

To understand how a sovereign mint runs out of metal, you have to understand the game that’s been played for the last fifteen years. After the 2008 crisis, the rules were simple. The price of silver wasn't set by physical supply and demand. It was set in the paper markets of New York and London by a handful of bullion banks.

Think of it like this: for every one hundred ounces of physical silver sitting in a registered vault, these banks could create thousands of paper contracts—futures, options, ETFs—all claiming ownership of that same silver. As long as very few people demanded actual delivery, the system worked. The paper price stayed low, and the banks collected their fees. They built a financial machine designed to contain silver, ensuring it never threatened the dominance of the dollar.

But they made a fatal miscalculation. They forgot you can't build an electric vehicle with a paper promise. Starting around 2021, the world’s industrial giants quietly became the largest buyers on the market. Every solar panel, every 5G tower, every microchip became a vacuum cleaner for physical silver. Last year alone, industrial demand outstripped new mine supply by over 230 million ounces. Write that down. Two hundred and thirty million ounces that had to come from somewhere.

For years, that deficit was filled by draining existing stockpiles. But now, those stockpiles are hitting rock bottom. The industrial users are calling the banks' bluff. They don't want the paper. They want the metal. And the price you see on your screen has no connection to the reality of that physical scarcity.

This entire house of cards was built on a hidden mechanism, a pressure valve designed to keep the paper fantasy from colliding with the physical world. And that valve just failed.

The game was simple because the players were powerful. After 2008, central banks flooded the world with trillions in new currency. To keep that tidal wave of cash from sparking hyperinflation, they needed to control the traditional barometers of fear: gold and silver.

So, the bullion banks—the JP Morgans and HSBCs of the world—stepped in as the system’s managers. Their tool of choice? The COMEX futures market.

Here’s how the machine worked. For every single ounce of real, physical silver sitting in a vault, the banks could create and sell one hundred, two hundred, sometimes even five hundred paper contracts representing that ounce. Think of it as selling 500 tickets to a single seat in a theater. The scheme only works as long as everyone doesn't show up at once demanding their seat.

For fifteen years, it was the perfect price suppression tool. Any time investor demand pushed silver’s price up, the banks would unleash a flood of new paper contracts, overwhelming the market and crushing the price back down. They could create a limitless supply of paper to meet a very real demand for metal.

This gave you the illusion of a deep, liquid market. It kept the price stable, predictable, and most importantly, low. It was a gilded cage, designed to trap capital and prevent a panic.

But what happens when people stop wanting the paper ticket, and start demanding the actual metal? The entire system relies on a bluff. And for the last 18 months, a massive, unseen player has been quietly calling that bluff, exposing a hidden mechanism at the heart of this collapse.

So how is this possible? How can the U.S. Mint run out of a metal when your screen says the price is only $90 an ounce?

It's because you're being shown the wrong price. You're looking at a shadow. The real action is happening somewhere else, governed by a mechanism I call The Great Disconnect. It’s the secret that underpins the entire precious metals market, and it’s coming apart at the seams.

Here’s how it works. Think of it as two separate markets for the exact same thing.

First, you have the Paper Market. This is the futures price you see on Bloomberg, the number every financial news channel quotes. It’s not a price for silver in your hand. It’s the price for a promise of silver, delivered sometime in the future. For years, this paper price has been used to control the narrative, to keep a lid on things.

Second, you have the Physical Market. This is the real world. It’s the price a mint pays to acquire the massive silver discs—the planchets—before they can be stamped into coins. It’s the price an industrial buyer pays for the silver they need today for solar panels and electronics.

Normally, these two prices walk in lockstep. But they aren't anymore.

Imagine you walk into a dealership to buy a new truck. The sticker price on the website is $50,000. But the lot is completely empty. The dealer just shrugs. He can’t get any. Then you see a guy in the parking lot with the exact truck you want. He just bought the last one. And he’ll sell it to you, right now, for $80,000 cash.

Which one is the real price? The one on the website, or the one that actually gets you the truck?

That’s The Great Disconnect. The U.S. Mint is trapped in the middle. They’re the dealer, forced to honor a sticker price that has no connection to reality. They have to buy their silver at the parking lot price but are expected to sell it to you at the website price. When that gap gets wide enough, the whole system shorts out. They have no choice but to pull the plug.

This isn't a theory. The gap between the paper promise and the physical price is measurable. It’s a number. And when you run that number, you don’t just see a problem… you see a countdown clock.

This isn't just a market. It's two markets, running in parallel. One is real, made of physical metal you can hold in your hand. The other is a phantom, built from paper contracts and digital promises. For years, they’ve been shackled together. Now, we are witnessing what I call The Great Silver Uncoupling.

Here’s how the game has been played, step-by-step.

First, the price you see on your screen is set on futures exchanges like the COMEX. Here, banks trade contracts for silver. They can create and sell a contract representing 100 ounces of silver without actually having 100 ounces of silver. They are, in effect, creating paper metal out of thin air.

Second, for decades, these banks have used this power to manage the price. Any time physical demand starts to push the price up, they can flood the market with billions of dollars in new paper contracts, overwhelming the real buyers and hammering the price back down. It’s a powerful illusion.

Third, the entire system relies on one critical assumption: that almost nobody will ever ask for the real metal. As long as traders are happy to settle their contracts for cash, the banks never have to prove they have the silver they supposedly sold.

Think of it like a valet service at a sold-out stadium. They’ve given out 5,000 parking stubs, but they only have 50 parking spots. It works fine as long as everyone leaves at different times. But what happens when the game ends, and all 5,000 people rush the valet stand at once, demanding their car keys?

That is what is happening right now. The game is over. Industrial users, sovereign mints, and individual investors are all rushing the valet stand. They don't want the paper stub anymore. They want the car. They want the physical metal. The U.S. Mint showed up to get its keys, and the valet just shrugged. The lot is empty.

This isn't a guess. It's not a prediction. The evidence is right there in the exchange data, hiding in plain sight. And when you run the numbers, you see the deficit isn't just a problem… it’s a mathematical black hole.

The numbers don't lie. And these are the numbers the banks hoped you would never see.

Right now, on the COMEX exchange, a staggering 36 million ounces of silver are standing for delivery. That’s not for the whole year. That’s for this month. To put that in perspective, that’s more than two full months of output from Mexico, the largest silver producer on the planet. All of it demanded in a single 30-day window.

But that’s just the paper market. Here’s the number that proves the physical game is over.

Your screen says silver is ninety dollars an ounce. But try to buy it. Right now. Go ahead. Authorized purchasers are reporting physical premiums of 50 percent over that paper price. If they can even get an allocation.

Do the math with me. Ninety dollars… times one-point-five… is one hundred and thirty-five dollars. That isn’t a premium. That’s a panic price. The gap between the paper fantasy you see on TV and the physical reality at the counter is now a forty-five-dollar chasm. It’s the market screaming that the emperor has no clothes.

This is the mathematical result of a 300-million-ounce structural deficit. That’s the number whispered in the industry, the one no one wants to say out loud. For every ten ounces of silver demanded for solar panels, EVs, and investment bars this year, only about eight ounces are being pulled from the ground. For years, they filled that gap by draining the vaults in London and New York.

But now the vaults are running on fumes. The U.S. Mint just sent up the flare.

So what happens when a 300-million-ounce vacuum gets turned on in a market held together by digital promises? The system doesn't just bend. It snaps. And when it does, there are only three ways this can play out from here.

That 36-million-ounce demand isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a claim check being slammed on the counter of a warehouse that is nearly empty.

The official COMEX report will tell you there are 45 million ounces of registered silver in their vaults. On paper, that looks fine. A 9-million-ounce cushion. But this is the lie that keeps the whole system from imploding. "Registered" simply means the bar is the right shape and purity. It doesn't mean the owner is willing to sell it. It's like looking at every car in a parking garage and assuming they're all for sale. They aren't.

The real number, the amount traders are actually willing to part with for $90 paper dollars? Insiders I talk to say it’s barely 20 million ounces.

Do the math with me. Demand: 36 million. Real, available supply: 20 million. That is a 16-million-ounce black hole opening up in the heart of the market. This month. On just one exchange.

And this is where the contagion starts. Because every single entity that gets stiffed on delivery in New York—the banks, the mints, the industrial giants like Apple and Tesla—they will all pivot and make a panicked phone call to the only other vault that matters: London.

The LBMA claims to hold 850 million ounces. A staggering number. But it’s a gilded cage. Over 700 million of those ounces are legally owned by ETFs, held as sovereign reserves, or allocated to private clients. That silver is not for sale. It cannot be touched. It’s like looking at a bank’s vault but forgetting that the money inside belongs to its depositors.

The real floating supply for the entire planet is less than 150 million ounces. And a 16-million-ounce deficit from New York is about to become a vacuum cleaner aimed right at it.

The system is no longer just broken. It's running on fumes. The engine is seizing in real-time. So, what happens when the paper promises are finally called, and the vaults are proven empty? There are only a few possible roads from here. And you need to understand every single one of them.

So what happens now? When the gears of this machine finally grind to a halt, what does the world look like? As I see it, two primary paths are emerging from the chaos, and you need to understand both.

Let’s call the first one the “Controlled Demolition.” This is the scenario the central banks are desperately trying to engineer. They find the metal. They raid a private vault in Zurich, they twist the arm of a major industrial ETF, and they satisfy just enough of that 36-million-ounce delivery demand to calm the markets. The U.S. Mint might come back online in a week, but with strict, one-coin-per-household rationing. The paper price gets hammered back under $90 as they flood the market with a fresh wave of shorts. The system bends, but it doesn't break. The financial media will call it a “successful stress test.” Let's put the probability of this at 60 percent. It's the path of least resistance.

But then there is the second path. The “Force Majeure.” This is what happens if the metal simply isn’t there. One major bullion bank fails to deliver. It’s a quiet default at first, settled in cash. Then another. Then panic. COMEX is forced to halt trading. The price on your screen freezes at $90.38, but it's an artifact. A museum piece. The real price is discovered in frantic phone calls between dealers, and it starts with a two. Two hundred dollars? Two hundred and fifty? The LBMA in London follows suit within 48 hours. This isn’t a squeeze. It’s a reset. The probability? I'd put it at a terrifying 40 percent, and it’s climbing with every truck that leaves the COMEX empty.

Of course, the skeptics will roll their eyes. They’ll tell you we’ve seen this movie before. That the banks always find the metal, that they can print paper contracts forever to crush any rally. And in the past, they’ve had a point. But this time, they are ignoring the one player in this game who just changed all the rules.

The first path is what the insiders are hoping for. I call it the Controlled Demolition.

In this scenario, they don’t try to fix the system—they break it on their own terms. The COMEX and the LBMA declare a temporary "force majeure," suspending all physical delivery. They try to settle every contract in cash, forcing you to accept rapidly devaluing dollars instead of the metal you were promised.

To create confusion, they might even slam the paper price back down to $80, maybe even $70, to shake out the weak hands. But in the real world, the price of a one-ounce coin you can actually hold could leap to $150, then $200, overnight. The gap between their price and the real price becomes a chasm.

Then there is Scenario B: The Great Unplugging.

This is what happens when control is lost. The default isn’t managed; it’s a catastrophic failure. One major bank fails to deliver, and the chain reaction is immediate. Confidence in the entire paper market evaporates in a single trading session. The price doesn't just re-rate; it breaks entirely. Price discovery moves from the futures exchanges in New York and London to the physical dealers on the street.

What's the price then? Two hundred an ounce? Five hundred? What is the price of something real when the fiction is finally exposed?

I’d put the probability of the Controlled Demolition at 70 percent. But that leaves a terrifying 30 percent chance of a complete, uncontrolled reset.

Of course, the skeptics will tell you this is just fear-mongering. They’ll say it’s a temporary supply chain issue, that the banks can print infinite paper contracts to contain any rally. They believe the system is simply too big to fail. But they are ignoring the one fatal flaw in their logic, the one player who just changed all the rules.

Now, I know what the critics are saying. And frankly, the mainstream headlines are designed to make you agree with them. They're calling this a “temporary technical suspension.” A “precautionary pause” due to market volatility. They want you to believe this is just a boring, bureaucratic hiccup. That the U.S. Mint is simply being responsible, tapping the brakes because the price moved a little too fast.

And on the surface, it sounds plausible. But it completely falls apart the second you look at the data.

Let’s rewind to the last major silver run in early 2021. The price rocketed up nearly twenty percent in just a few days. Did the Mint erase the “buy” button from existence? No. They limited orders. They announced shipping delays. They managed the surge. They never, ever, shut the entire operation down.

So what makes this time different?

It’s because this isn’t about the price on your screen. It’s about the metal in the vault. Here is the number that exposes the official story as a lie. While the Mint cites volatility around a ninety-dollar paper price, my sources inside the wholesale market confirm premiums for 1,000-ounce bars have gone parabolic. We’re talking a forty percent premium over spot. Forty percent. That’s just to get the raw industrial metal, before it's ever stamped into a coin.

The U.S. Mint didn't stop selling because the price is too high. They stopped because they physically cannot source silver anywhere near the price they're supposed to. The machine is broken.

This is where the official narrative crumbles, and you have to decide what you believe. The sanitized press release, or the hard numbers from the physical market. For me, that choice was made a long time ago, and it's reflected in every single dollar I've put to work.

But the smartest objection isn’t that this is temporary. It’s that this is a simple logistics problem.

The argument goes like this: “Sure, COMEX is tight, but there are hundreds of millions of ounces sitting in London vaults and backing ETFs like the iShares Silver Trust. There’s no real shortage, just a delay in moving metal from Warehouse A to Warehouse B.”

On the surface, it sounds reasonable. It sounds professional. And it’s dangerously wrong.

Let’s look at the facts. If this were just a logistics issue, those giant stockpiles would be the ultimate backstop. But they’re not acting like a backstop. They're acting like a leaking dam. The iShares Silver Trust, SLV, is supposed to be a vault. Instead, it’s become a drive-thru for institutions desperate for physical metal. Over the last year, we've watched a staggering 53 million ounces get pulled from its vaults. That's not metal being ‘re-routed.’ That's a direct raid on the reserves.

And London? The story gets even worse. The London Bullion Market Association, the heart of the global silver trade, has seen its inventories plummet to near-record lows. This isn't just one month of bad data; it's a relentless trend. The very vaults the critics point to as the solution are actually flashing the biggest warning sign of all. The so-called “silver mountains” are turning into molehills.

This isn’t a shell game where metal is moving from one pocket to another. This is a global vacuum cleaner, and it's sucking the physical inventory out of the entire system. The paper promises are finally being called in. And seeing these numbers, watching the emergency reserves get drained in real-time, has forced me to change how I approach my own security.

So, the question I keep getting is, what am I doing with my own money? I’m not sitting on my hands. Yesterday morning, after I confirmed the Mint’s suspension, I increased my personal allocation to physical silver. I moved it from 10% of my net worth up to 15%. For me, this isn't a speculative gamble on the price going up. It’s a calculated exit from the paper phantom market. It’s an insurance policy against the very system failure we are now watching unfold, minute by minute.

Now, let me be crystal clear. This is not financial advice, and I am not your advisor. This is simply a transparent look at my personal strategy for protecting my own family's wealth. You must do your own exhaustive research and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance.

My trigger for a much larger, more aggressive position is simple: I’m watching the London Bullion Market Association. The LBMA. The moment they announce any kind of delivery halt or suspension—even a ‘temporary’ one—that’s the final signal. That is the point of no return for the paper pricing scheme.

Because what’s coming isn’t a gentle, orderly repricing. This isn't a stock climbing a chart. Think of it like a coiled spring, compressed for fifteen years by trillions in paper contracts. The U.S. Mint just snapped one of the clamps holding it down. And when the last one breaks, we are not going to see a rally. We are going to witness a launch.

This is the moment the paper market dies. The U.S. Mint didn't just run out of silver; it ran out of time. The decades-long game of suppressing physical reality with digital promises has finally hit a wall of empty vaults. This isn't a "temporary suspension"—it's a distress flare, a final warning that the system you trust is buckling under the weight of its own lies. The price on your screen is a phantom. The real price is being set by a desperate, global scramble for physical metal.

This contagion is moving faster than the news cycle. London is next. When the LBMA admits it can't deliver, the final anchor will be cut. I’m tracking the vault data as it breaks. Subscribe and turn on notifications. You need this intel before it's too late.

In the end, they can control the headlines, but they can't print metal.
